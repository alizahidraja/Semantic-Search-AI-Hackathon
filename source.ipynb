The reasons for these changes are unclear. The hormones affected are:  - Estrogen and progesterone, the female hormones that help a woman's ovaries release eggs   - Androgen, a male hormone that is found in small amounts in women   Normally, one or more eggs are released during a woman's cycle. This is known as ovulation. In most cases, this release of eggs occurs about 2 weeks after the start of a menstrual period.   In PCOS, mature eggs are not released. Instead, they stay in the ovaries with a small amount of fluid around them. There can be many of these. However, not all women with the condition will have ovaries with this appearance.   These problems with the release of eggs can contribute to infertility. The other symptoms of this disorder are due to thehormoneimbalances.  Most of the time, PCOS is diagnosed in women in their 20s or 30s. However, it may also affect teenage girls. The symptoms often begin when a girl's periods start.

Clusters of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, develop in the kidneys and interfere with their ability to filter waste products from the blood. The growth of cysts causes the kidneys to become enlarged and can lead to kidney failure. Cysts may also develop in other organs, particularly the liver.  Frequent complications of polycystic kidney disease include dangerously high blood pressure (hypertension), pain in the back or sides, blood in the urine (hematuria), recurrent urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and heart valve abnormalities. Additionally, people with polycystic kidney disease have an increased risk of an abnormal bulging (an aneurysm) in a large blood vessel called the aorta or in blood vessels at the base of the brain. Aneurysms can be life-threatening if they tear or rupture.  The two major forms of polycystic kidney disease are distinguished by the usual age of onset and the pattern in which it is passed through families. The autosomal dominant form (sometimes called ADPKD) has signs and symptoms that typically begin in adulthood, although cysts in the kidney are often present from birth or childhood. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can be further divided into type 1 and type 2, depending on the genetic cause. The autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease (sometimes called ARPKD) is much rarer and is often lethal early in life.

Mutations in either the PKD1 or PKD2 gene can cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; PKD1 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 1, and PKD2 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 2. These genes provide instructions for making proteins whose functions are not fully understood. Researchers believe that they are involved in transmitting chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. The two proteins work together to promote normal kidney development, organization, and function. Mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene lead to the formation of thousands of cysts, which disrupt the normal functions of the kidneys and other organs. People with mutations in the PKD2 gene, particularly women, typically have a less severe form of the disease than people with PKD1 mutations. The signs and symptoms, including a decline in kidney function, tend to appear later in adulthood in people with a PKD2 mutation.  Mutations in the PKHD1 gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. This gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unknown; however, the protein likely transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus. Researchers have not determined how mutations in the PKHD1 gene lead to the formation of numerous cysts characteristic of polycystic kidney disease.  Although polycystic kidney disease is usually a genetic disorder, a small percentage of cases are not caused by gene mutations. These cases are called acquired polycystic kidney disease.

The other 10 percent of cases result from a new mutation in one of the genes and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  Although one altered copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, an additional mutation in the second copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene may make cysts grow faster and increase the severity of the disease. The rate at which cysts enlarge and cause a loss of kidney function varies widely, and may be influenced by mutations in other genes that have not been identified.  Polycystic kidney disease also can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. People with this form of the condition have two altered copies of the PKHD1 gene in each cell.

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Without a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body.  Celiac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containing gluten. The classic symptoms of the condition result from inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. This inflammation damages the villi, which are small, finger-like projections that line the small intestine and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. Intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. Abdominal pain, swelling (distention), and food intolerances are common in celiac disease. Inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus.  Inflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. These health problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood cells (anemia), vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density (osteoporosis), itchy skin rashes (dermatitis herpetiformis), defects in the enamel of the teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, infertility, or repeated miscarriages.

(Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/celiac-disease The risk of developing celiac disease is increased by certain variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.  The proteins produced from the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes attach (bind) to each other to form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DQ heterodimer. This complex, which is present on the surface of certain immune system cells, attaches to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.  Celiac disease is associated with an inappropriate immune response to a segment of the gluten protein called gliadin. This inappropriate activation of the immune system causes inflammation that damages the body's organs and tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of celiac disease.  Almost all people with celiac disease have specific variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, which seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to gliadin. However, these variants are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with the gene variants develop celiac disease.

The weakness most often starts in the muscles around the eyes, causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and difficulty coordinating eye movements, which results in blurred or double vision. In a form of the disorder called ocular myasthenia, the weakness remains confined to the eye muscles. In most people with myasthenia gravis, however, additional muscles in the face and neck are affected. Affected individuals may have unusual facial expressions, difficulty holding up the head, speech impairment (dysarthria), and chewing and swallowing problems (dysphagia) that may lead to choking, gagging, or drooling.  Other muscles in the body are also affected in some people with myasthenia gravis. The muscles of the arms and legs may be involved, causing affected individuals to have changes in their gait or trouble with lifting objects, rising from a seated position, or climbing stairs. The muscle weakness tends to fluctuate over time; it typically worsens with activity and improves with rest.  Weakness of the muscles in the chest wall and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can cause breathing problems in some people with myasthenia gravis. About 10 percent of people with this disorder experience a potentially life-threatening complication in which these respiratory muscles weaken to the point that breathing is dangerously impaired, and the affected individual requires ventilation assistance.

The most common feature of this condition is recurrent seizures (epilepsy) in childhood. The seizures may occur during the day or at night during sleep. They are described as partial seizures because they affect only one area of the brain, a region called the frontal lobe. In many cases, the seizures are complex and resistant to treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. Prolonged seizure episodes known as non-convulsive status epilepticus also appear to be characteristic of ring chromosome 20 syndrome. These episodes involve confusion and behavioral changes.  Most people with ring chromosome 20 syndrome also have some degree of intellectual disability and behavioral difficulties. Although these problems can appear either before or after the onset of epilepsy, they tend to worsen after seizures develop. Additional features of this condition can include slow growth and short stature, a small head (microcephaly), and subtle differences in facial features.

A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and its broken ends fuse together. People with ring chromosome 20 syndrome have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells.  It is not well understood how the ring chromosome causes the signs and symptoms of this syndrome. In some affected individuals, genes near the ends of chromosome 20 are deleted when the ring chromosome forms. Researchers suspect that the loss of these genes may be responsible for epilepsy and other health problems. However, other affected individuals do not have gene deletions associated with the ring chromosome. In these people, the ring chromosome may change the activity of certain genes on chromosome 20, or it may be unable to copy (replicate) itself normally during cell division. Researchers are still working to determine the precise relationship between the ring chromosome 20 and the characteristic features of the syndrome.)  \", \"x\": -1.745362639427185, \"y\": 6.746819496154785}, {\"text\": \"Is ring chromosome 20 syndrome inherited ?

Phosphate salts are taken by mouth for treating blood phosphate levels that are too low and blood calcium levels that are too high, and for preventing kidney stones. They are also taken for treating osteomalacia (often called rickets in children), a condition caused by a mineral imbalance in the body that leads to softening of the bones. Phosphate salts are also used for improving exercise performance, as an antacid for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and as a laxative for emptying the bowels before surgery.     Phosphate salts and calcium are applied to sensitive teeth to reduce pain.     Rectally, phosphate salts are used as a laxative to clean the bowels before surgery or intestinal tests.

This bacterium causes infection when it gets into broken skin or mucus membranes, usually of the genitals. Syphilis is most often transmitted through sexual contact, although it also can be transmitted in other ways.  Syphilis occurs worldwide, most commonly in urban areas. The number of cases is rising fastest in men who have sex with men. Young adults ages 15 to 25 are the highest-risk population. People have no natural resistance to syphilis.  Because people may be unaware that they are infected with syphilis, many states require tests for syphilis before marriage. All pregnant women who receive prenatal care should be screened for syphilis to prevent the infection from passing to their newborn (congenital syphilis).

If you do not treat it, syphilis usually causes a non-itchy skin rash, often on your hands and feet. Many people do not notice symptoms for years. Symptoms can go away and come back.    The sores caused by syphilis make it easier to get or give someone HIV during sex. If you are pregnant, syphilis can cause birth defects, or you could lose your baby. In rare cases, syphilis causes serious health problems and even death.    Syphilis is easy to cure with antibiotics if you catch it early.

This type of anemia leads to paleness, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. In people with glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency, hemolytic anemia is most often triggered by bacterial or viral infections or by certain drugs (such as some antibiotics and medications used to treat malaria).

These may include reading about the operation and talking to others with knee or hip problems.  A key step is talking to your health care provider about your quality of life and goals for surgery.  Surgery may or may not be the right choice for you. Only careful thought can help you make a decision.  Who Benefits From Knee or hip Replacement Surgery? : The most common reason to have a knee or hip replaced is to provide relief from severe arthritis pain that limits your activities. Your provider may recommend replacement surgery when:  - Pain prevents you from sleeping or doing normal activities.  - You cannot move around by yourself and have to use a cane or walker.  - Your pain has not improved with other treatment.  - You understand the surgery and recovery involved.    Some people are more willing to accept the limits knee or hip pain places on them. They will wait until the problems are more severe. Others will want to have joint replacement surgery in order to continue with sports and other activities they enjoy.  Knee or hip replacements are most often done in people who are 60 and older. However, many people who have this surgery are younger. When a knee or hip replacement is done, the new joint may wear out over time. This is more likely to occur in people with more active lifestyles or in those who will likely live longer after surgery. Unfortunately, if a second joint replacement is needed in the future, it may not work as well as the first.  Is There any Harm in Waiting? : For the most part, knee and hip replacement are elective procedures. This means these surgeries are done to provide relief for your pain, not for any other medical reason.  In most cases, delaying surgery should not make joint replacement less effective if you choose to have it in the future.

One or both parts may be replaced during surgery:  -  The hip socket (a part of the pelvic bone called the acetabulum)   -  The upper end of the thighbone (called the femoral head)    The new hip that replaces the old one is made up of these parts:  - A socket, which is usually made of strong metal.  - A liner, which fits inside the socket. It is usually plastic, but some surgeons are now trying other materials, like ceramic. The liner allows the hip to move smoothly.  - A metal or ceramic ball that will replace the round head (top) of your thigh bone.  - A metal stem that is attached to the thigh bone to make the joint more stable.    You will not feel any pain during surgery. You will have one of two types of anesthesia:  - General anesthesia. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain.   -  Regional (spinal or epidural anesthesia). Medicine is put into your back to make you numb below your waist. You will also get medicine to make you sleepy. And you may get medicine that will make you forget about the procedure, even though you will not be fully asleep.

It uses a smaller surgical cut. Also, fewer muscles around the hip are cut or detached.  Description : To perform this surgery:  - A cut will be made in one of three places -- on the back of the hip (over the buttock), on the front of the hip (near the groin), or on the side of the hip.  - In most cases, the cut will be 3to 6 inches long. In a regular hip replacement surgery, the cut is 10to 12 inches long.  - The surgeon will use special instruments to work through the small cut.  - Surgery involves cutting and removing bone. The surgeon will remove some muscles and other tissues. Less tissue is removed than in regular surgery. Most of the time, muscles are not cut or detached.   This procedure uses the same type of hip replacement implants as regular surgery.

The person may ask to be moved up higher for comfort or may need to be moved up so a health care provider can do an exam.  Avoiding injury : You must move or pull someone up in bed the right way to avoid injuring the patient's shoulders and skin. Using the right method will also help protect your back.  It takes at least two people to safely move a patient up in bed.  Friction from rubbing can scrape or tear the person's skin. Common areas at risk for friction are the shoulders, back, buttocks, elbows, and heels.   Never move patients up by grabbing them under their arms and pulling. This can injure their shoulders.  Preparing to move the patient : A slide sheet is the best way to prevent friction. If you do not have one, you can make a draw sheet out of a bed sheet folded in half. Follow these steps to prepare the patient:  - Tell the patient what you are doing.  - Make the bed flat.  - Roll the patient to one side, then place a half rolled-up slide sheet or draw sheet against the person's back.  - Roll the patient onto the sheet and spread the sheet out flat under the person.  - Make sure the head, shoulders, and hips are on the sheet.

Place the person's top arm across the chest.  - Cross the patient's upper ankle over the bottom ankle.    If you are turning the patient onto the stomach, make sure the person's bottom hand is above the head first.  Turning a patient : - If you can, raise the bed to a level that reduces back strain for you.

This is called the epidural space.  - The medicine numbs, or blocks feeling in a certain part of your body so that you cannot feel pain. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an epidural during childbirth.  - A small tube (catheter) is often left in place.

Causes : The urea cycle is a process in which waste (ammonia) is removed from the body. When you eat proteins, the body breaks them down into amino acids. Ammonia is produced from leftover amino acids, and it must be removed from the body.  The liver produces several chemicals (enzymes) that change ammonia into a form called urea, which the body can remove in the urine. If this process is disturbed, ammonia levels begin to rise.  Several inherited conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process. People with a urea cycle disorder are missing a gene that makes the enzymes needed to break down ammonia in the body.  These diseases include:  - Argininosuccinic aciduria  - Arginase deficiency  - Carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency  - Citrullinemia  - N-acetyl glutamate synthetase deficiency (NAGS)  - Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC)   As a group, these disorders occur in 1 in 30,000 newborns. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is the most common of these disorders.  Boys are more often affected by ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency than girls. Girls are rarely affected. Those girls who are affected have milder symptoms and develop the disease later in life.  To get the other types of disorders, you need to receive a non-working copy of the gene from both parents. Sometimes parents don't know they carry the gene until their child gets the disorder.  Symptoms : Typically, the baby begins nursing well and seems normal. However, over time the baby develops poor feeding, vomiting, and sleepiness, which may be so deep that the baby is difficult to awaken. This usually occurs within the first week after birth.

If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.

(Also called: alactasia; dairy product intolerance; hypolactasia; lactose malabsorption; milk sugar intolerance) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lactose-intolerance Lactose intolerance is an impaired ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Lactose is normally broken down by an enzyme called lactase, which is produced by cells in the lining of the small intestine.  Congenital lactase deficiency, also called congenital alactasia, is a disorder in which infants are unable to break down lactose in breast milk or formula. This form of lactose intolerance results in severe diarrhea. If affected infants are not given a lactose-free infant formula, they may develop severe dehydration and weight loss.  Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by reduced production of lactase after infancy (lactase nonpersistence). If individuals with lactose intolerance consume lactose-containing dairy products, they may experience abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, nausea, and diarrhea beginning 30 minutes to 2 hours later.  Most people with lactase nonpersistence retain some lactase activity and can include varying amounts of lactose in their diets without experiencing symptoms. Often, affected individuals have difficulty digesting fresh milk but can eat certain dairy products such as cheese or yogurt without discomfort. These foods are made using fermentation processes that break down much of the lactose in milk.)  \", \"x\": -0.14210672676563263, \"y\": 5.268653392791748}, {\"text\": \"What are the genetic changes related to lactose intolerance ?

The LCT gene provides instructions for making the lactase enzyme. Mutations that cause congenital lactase deficiency are believed to interfere with the function of lactase, causing affected infants to have a severely impaired ability to digest lactose in breast milk or formula.  Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by gradually decreasing activity (expression) of the LCT gene after infancy, which occurs in most humans. LCT gene expression is controlled by a DNA sequence called a regulatory element, which is located within a nearby gene called MCM6. Some individuals have inherited changes in this element that lead to sustained lactase production in the small intestine and the ability to digest lactose throughout life. People without these changes have a reduced ability to digest lactose as they get older, resulting in the signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance.)  \", \"x\": -0.42431557178497314, \"y\": 5.453377723693848}, {\"text\": \"Who should get Penicillin G Benzathine and Penicillin G Procaine Injection and why is it prescribed ? https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a615053.html Penicillin G benzathine and penicillin G procaine injection is used to treat and prevent certain infections caused by bacteria.

Affected individuals may develop problems with walking, speaking, and swallowing. People with these disorders also experience changes in personality and a decline in thinking and reasoning abilities.

The genetic cause of HDL3 is unknown.  The PRNP, JPH3, and TBP genes provide instructions for making proteins that are important for normal brain function. The features of HDL syndromes result from a particular type of mutation in any one of these genes. This mutation increases the length of a repeated segment of DNA within the gene, which leads to the production of an abnormal PRNP, JPH3, or TBP protein. The abnormal protein can build up in nerve cells (neurons) and disrupt the normal functions of these cells.

(Also called: GPA; Wegener granulomatosis; Wegener's granulomatosis) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis The genetic basis of GPA is not well understood. Having a particular version of the HLA-DPB1 gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for developing this condition, although several other genes, some of which have not been identified, may be involved. It is likely that a combination of genetic and environmental factors lead to GPA.  GPA is an autoimmune disorder. Such disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Approximately 90 percent of people with GPA have an abnormal immune protein called an anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) in their blood. Antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but ANCAs attack normal human proteins. Most people with GPA have an ANCA that attacks the human protein proteinase 3 (PR3). A few affected individuals have an ANCA that attacks a protein called myeloperoxidase (MPO). When these antibodies attach to the protein they recognize, they trigger inflammation, which contributes to the signs and symptoms of GPA.  The HLA-DPB1 gene belongs to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. A particular variant of the HLA-DPB1 gene called HLA-DPB1*0401 has been found more frequently in people with GPA, especially those with ANCAs, than in people without the condition.  Because the HLA-DPB1 gene is involved in the immune system, changes in it might be related to the autoimmune response and inflammation in the respiratory tract and kidneys characteristic of GPA.

It is caused by an infection with a type of streptococcus bacteria. The infection does not occur in the kidneys, but in a different part of the body, such as the skin or throat.  The strep bacterial infection causes the tiny blood vessels in the filtering units of the kidneys (glomeruli) to become inflamed. This makes the kidneys less able to filter the urine.  Post-streptococcal GN is uncommon today because infections that can lead to the disorder are commonly treated with antibiotics. The disorder may develop 1 to 2 weeks after an untreated throat infection, or 3 to 4 weeks after a skin infection.  It may occur in people of any age, but it most often occurs in children ages 6 through 10. Although skin and throat infections are common in children, post-streptococcal GN is a rare complication of these infections.

This disorder is also commonly known as Wegener granulomatosis. A characteristic feature of GPA is inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), particularly the small- and medium-sized blood vessels in the lungs, nose, sinuses, windpipe, and kidneys, although vessels in any organ can be involved. Polyangiitis refers to the inflammation of multiple types of vessels, such as small arteries and veins. Vasculitis causes scarring and tissue death in the vessels and impedes blood flow to tissues and organs.  Another characteristic feature of GPA is the formation of granulomas, which are small areas of inflammation composed of immune cells that aid in the inflammatory reaction. The granulomas usually occur in the lungs or airways of people with this condition, although they can occur in the eyes or other organs. As granulomas grow, they can invade surrounding areas, causing tissue damage.  The signs and symptoms of GPA vary based on the tissues and organs affected by vasculitis. Many people with this condition experience a vague feeling of discomfort (malaise), fever, weight loss, or other general symptoms of the body's immune reaction. In most people with GPA, inflammation begins in the vessels of the respiratory tract, leading to nasal congestion, frequent nosebleeds, shortness of breath, or coughing. Severe inflammation in the nose can lead to a hole in the tissue that separates the two nostrils (nasal septum perforation) or a collapse of the septum, causing a sunken bridge of the nose (saddle nose).  The kidneys are commonly affected in people with GPA. Tissue damage caused by vasculitis in the kidneys can lead to decreased kidney function, which may cause increas\", \"x\": -0.6140791177749634, \"y\": 8.300525665283203}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Streptococcal Infections ?

When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.  When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.

Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.  To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:  - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.  - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.     People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the bloodinto muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and because their liver makestoo much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:  - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin  - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally  - Both of the above    There are 2 major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:   - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.  - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease.Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.

The vision loss usually becomes noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tends to worsen over time.  Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not affected.  Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and slowly progressive vision loss. The condition typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other.  The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly. This form of the condition is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula.

Information : When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, the alcohol travels through her blood and into the baby's blood, tissues, and organs. Alcohol breaks down much more slowly in the baby's body than in an adult. That means the baby's blood alcohol level remains increased longer than the mother's.

Cholestasis is a condition that impairs the release of a digestive fluid called bile from liver cells. As a result, bile builds up in the liver, impairing liver function. Because the problems with bile release occur within the liver (intrahepatic), the condition is described as intrahepatic cholestasis. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy usually becomes apparent in the third trimester of pregnancy. Bile flow returns to normal after delivery of the baby, and the signs and symptoms of the condition disappear. However, they can return during later pregnancies.  This condition causes severe itchiness (pruritus) in the expectant mother. The itchiness usually begins on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet and then spreads to other parts of the body. Occasionally, affected women have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Some studies have shown that women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are more likely to develop gallstones sometime in their life than women who do not have the condition.  Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy can cause problems for the unborn baby. This condition is associated with an increased risk of premature delivery and stillbirth.

The camera is called an arthroscope. The procedure allows the doctor to detect problems and make repairs to your ankle without making larger cuts in the skin and tissue. This means that you may have less pain and recover more quickly than open surgery.  Description : You will likely receive general anesthesia before this surgery. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you will have regional anesthesia. Your leg and ankle area will be numbed so that you do not feel any pain. If you receive regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to make you very sleepy during the operation.  During the procedure, the surgeon does the following:  - Inserts the arthroscope into your ankle through a small incision. The scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the inside of your ankle.  - Inspects all the tissues of your ankle. These tissues include cartilage, bones, tendons, and ligaments.  - Repairs any damaged tissues. To do this, your surgeon makes 1 to 3 more small incisions and inserts other instruments through them. A tear in a muscle, tendon, or cartilage is fixed. Any damaged tissue is removed.    At the end of the surgery, the incisions will be closed with stitches and covered with a dressing (bandage). Most surgeons take pictures from the video monitor during the procedure to show you what they found and what repairs they made.  Your surgeon may need to do open surgery if there is a lot of damage.

Symptoms of infectious arthritis include       - Intense pain in the joint    - Joint redness and swelling    - Chills and fever    - Inability to move the area with the infected joint       One type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee, ankle, or toe. Sometimes, reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine out of the body. In women, an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women, it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.    To diagnose infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.)  \", \"x\": 1.7590960264205933, \"y\": 10.439980506896973}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Learning Disorders ?

This inflammation causes warmth, redness, swelling, and pain around the joints. A person also feels sick, tired, and sometimes feverish.

In addition, symptoms differ from person to person and can be more severe in some people than in others. Common tests for rheumatoid arthritis include - The rheumatoid factor test.

TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered \\\"problem drinkers.\\\" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your \\\"blood alcohol level.\\\" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50\", \"x\": 5.945643901824951, \"y\": 4.486813068389893}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Benign ear cyst or tumor ?

This is the nerve that is involved in hearing and balance. The test also checks for damage to the brain stem.  How the Test is Performed : This test stimulates your acoustic nerve by delivering cold or warm water or air into your ear canal. When cold water or air enters your ear and the inner ear changes temperature, it should cause fast, side-to-side eye movements called nystagmus. The test is done in the following way:  - Before the test, your ear, especially the eardrum,will bechecked. This is to make sureit isnormal.  - One ear is tested at a time.  - A small amount of cold water or air is gently delivered into one of your ears. Your eyes should show an involuntary movement called nystagmus. Then they should turn away from that ear and slowly back. If water is used, it is allowed to drain out of the ear canal.  - Next, a small amount of warm water or air is gently delivered into the same ear. Again, your eyes should show nystagmus. Then they should turn toward that ear and slowly back.  - Your other ear is tested in the same way.   During the test, the health care provider may observe your eyes directly. Most often, this test is done as part of another test called electronystagmography.  How to Prepare for the Test : Do not eat a heavy meal before the test. Avoid the following at least 24 hours before the test, because they can affect the results:  - Alcohol  - Allergy medicines  - Caffeine  - Sedatives   Do not stop taking your regular medicines without first talking to yourdoctor.  How the Test will Feel : You may find the cold water or air in the ear uncomfortable. You may feel your eyes scanning back and forth during nystagmus.

Information : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity.

Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober.

The wax will most often make its way to the opening of the ear. There it will fall out or be removed by washing.   Wax can build up and block the ear canal. Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss.  Causes : Ear wax protects the ear by:  - Trapping and preventing dust, bacteria, and other germs and smallobjects from entering and damaging the ear   - Protecting the delicate skin of the ear canal from getting irritated when water is in the canal   In some people, the glands produce more wax than can be easily removed from the ear. This extra wax may harden in the ear canal and block the ear. When you try to clean the ear, you may instead push wax deeperand blockthe ear canal.  Symptoms : - Earache  - Fullness in the ear or a sensation that the ear is plugged  - Noises in the ear (tinnitus)  - Partial hearing loss, may get worse  Treatment : Most cases of ear wax blockage can be treated at home.

The wax will most often make its way to the opening of the ear. There it will fall out or be removed by washing.   Wax can build up and block the ear canal. Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss.  Causes : Ear wax protects the ear by:  - Trapping and preventing dust, bacteria, and other germs and smallobjects from entering and damaging the ear   - Protecting the delicate skin of the ear canal from getting irritated when water is in the canal   In some people, the glands produce more wax than can be easily removed from the ear. This extra wax may harden in the ear canal and block the ear. When you try to clean the ear, you may instead push wax deeperand blockthe ear canal.

You have many choices, so it can be hard to know what to buy. Learn about the different options and how to care for bottles and nipples.  How to Choose Bottles and Nipples : The type of nipple and bottle you choose will mainly depend on which type your baby will use. Some babies prefer a certain nipple shape, or they may have less gas with certain bottles. Others are less fussy. Start by buying a few different types of bottles and nipples. That way, you can try them out and see what works best for you and your baby.  Nipples : Nipples can be made from latex or silicone.  - Latex nipples are softer and more flexible. But some babies are sensitive to latex, and it does not last as long as silicone.  - Silicone nipples last longer and tend to hold their shape better.    Nipples come in different shapes.  - They can be dome-shaped, flat, or wide. Flat or wide nipples are shaped more like a mother's breast.  - Try different shapes to see which one your baby prefers.    Nipples come in different flow rates.  - You can get nipples that have a slow, medium, or fast flow rate. These nipples are often numbered, 1 is the slowest flow.  - Infants usually start with a smaller hole and slower flow. You will increase the size as your baby gets better at feeding and drinks more.  - Your baby should be able to get enough milk without having to suck too hard.  - If your baby is choking or spitting up, the flow is too fast.  Baby Bottles : Baby bottles come in different materials.  - Plastic bottles are lightweight and will not break if dropped. If you choose plastic, it is best to buy new bottles. Reused or hand-me-down bottles may contain bisphenol-A (BPA). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of BPA in baby bottles due to safety concerns.  - Glass\", \"x\": 2.0825626850128174, \"y\": 5.244818210601807}, {\"text\": \"Do you have information about Drain opener poisoning (Also called: Drain opening agents) https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002780.htm Summary : Drain opening agents are chemicals used to open clogged drains, often in homes.

Description : Surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia so you will be asleep and pain-free. To perform the surgery:  - The surgeon makes a 5 to 7 inch cut in the upper right part of your belly, just below your ribs.  - The area is opened up so the surgeon can view the gallbladder and separate it from the other organs.  - The surgeon cuts the bile duct and blood vessels that lead to the gallbladder.  - The gallbladder is gently lifted out and removed from your body.    An x-ray called a cholangiogram may be done during your surgery.   - To do this test, dye is injected into your common bile duct and an x-ray is taken. The dye helps find stones that may be outside your gallbladder.  - If other stones are found, the surgeon may remove them with a special instrument.   The surgery takes about 1 hour.  Why the Procedure is Performed : You may need this surgery if you have pain or other symptoms from gallstones. You may also need surgery if your gallbladder is not working normally.  Common symptoms may include:  - Indigestion, including bloating, heartburn, and gas   - Nausea and vomiting  - Pain after eating, usually in the upper right or upper middle area of your belly (epigastric pain)    The most common way to remove the gallbladder is by using a medical instrument called a laparoscope (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Open gallbladder surgery is used when laparoscopic surgery cannot be done safely. In some cases, the surgeon needs to switch to an open surgery if laparoscopic surgery cannot be successfully continued.

Infant formulas include powders, concentrated liquids, and ready-to-use forms.  Food Sources : There are different formulas available for infants younger than 12 months old who are not drinking breast milk. While there are some differences, infant formulas sold in the United States have all the nutrients babies need to grow and thrive.  TYPES OF FORMULAS  Babies need iron in their diet. It's best to use a formula fortified with iron, unless your child's doctor says not to.  Standard cow's milk-based formulas:  - Almost all babies do well on cow's milk-based formulas.  - These formulas are made with cow's milk protein that has been changed to be more like breast milk. They contain lactose (a type of sugar in milk) and minerals from the cow's milk.  - Vegetable oils, plus other minerals and vitamins are also in the formula.  - Fussiness and colic are common problems for all babies.

If you're not sure, talk with your infant's doctor.    Soy-based formulas:  - These formulas are made using soy proteins. They do not contain lactose.  - The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggests using cow's milk-based formulas when possible rather than soy-based formulas.  - For parents who do not want their child to eat animal protein, the AAP recommends breastfeeding. Soy-based formulas are also an option.  - Soy-based formulas have NOT been proven to help with milk allergies or colic.

The sample is then examined for cancer, infection, or lung disease.  How the Test is Performed : An open lung biopsy is done in the hospital using general anesthesia, which means you are asleep and pain-free. A tube will be placed through your mouth down your throat to help you breathe.  The surgery is done in the following way:  - After cleaning the skin, the surgeon makes a small cut in the left or right side of your chest.  - The ribs are gently separated.  - Tissue is taken from the lung and sent to a laboratory for examination.  - After surgery, the wound is closed with stitches.  - Your surgeon may leave a small plastic tube in your chest to prevent air and fluid from building up.  How to Prepare for the Test : You should tell the health care provider if you are pregnant, allergic to any medicines, or if you have a bleeding problem. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take, including herbs, supplements, and those bought without a prescription.   Follow your surgeon's instructions for not eating or drinking before the procedure.  How the Test will Feel : When you wake up after the procedure, you will feel drowsy for several hours.   There will be some tenderness and pain where the surgical cut is located. Most surgeons inject a long-acting local anesthetic at the surgical cut site so that you will have very little pain afterwards.  You may have a sore throat from the tube.

This tissue is called the pleura.  How the Test is Performed : An open pleural biopsy is done in the hospital using general anesthesia, which means you are asleep and pain-free. A tube will be placed through your mouth down your throat to help you breathe.  The surgery is done in the following way:  - After cleaning the skin, the surgeon makes a small cut in the left or right side of the chest.  - The ribs are gently separated.   - Tissue is taken from inside the chest and sent to a laboratory for examination.  - After surgery, the wound is closed with stitches.  - Your surgeon may decide to leave a small plastic tube in your chest to prevent air and fluid from building up  How to Prepare for the Test : You should tell the health care provider if you are pregnant, allergic to any medicines, or if you have a bleeding problem. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take, including herbs, supplements, and those bought without a prescription.   Follow your surgeon's instructions for not eating or drinking before the procedure.  How the Test will Feel : When you wake up after the procedure, you will feel drowsy for several hours.   There will be some tenderness and pain where the surgical cut is located. Most surgeons inject a long-acting local anesthetic at the surgical cut site so that you will have very little pain afterwards.  You may have a sore throat from the breathing tube. You can ease the pain by eating ice chips.  Why the Test is Performed : This procedure is used when the surgeon needs a larger piece of tissue than can be removed with a pleural needle biopsy. The test is most often done to rule out mesothelioma.  It is also done when there is fluid in the chest cavity, or when a direct view of the pleura and the lungs is needed. \", \"x\": 1.7510566711425781, \"y\": 7.146338939666748}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Questions to ask your doctor before knee replacement ? https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000665.htm How do I know if knee replacement surgery will help me?  - Is there any harm in waiting?  - Am I too young or too old for knee replacement?  - What else can be done for knee arthritis besides surgery?  - What is minimally invasive knee replacement surgery?

These foods contain gluten, a type of protein. A gluten-free diet is the main treatment for celiac disease. Some people believe a gluten-free diet can also help improve other health problems, but there is little research to support this idea.  Reasons to Avoid Gluten : People follow a gluten-free diet for a number of reasons:  Celiac disease. People with this condition cannot eat gluten because it triggers an immune response that damages the lining of their stomach. This response causes inflammation in the small intestine and makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients in food. Symptoms include bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.  Gluten sensitivity. People with gluten sensitivity do not have celiac disease. Eating gluten causes many of the same symptoms as in celiac disease, without the stomach damage.  Gluten intolerance. This describes people who have symptoms and may or may not have celiac disease. Symptoms include cramping, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea.  If you have one of these conditions, a gluten-free diet will help control your symptoms. It also helps prevent health problems in people with celiac disease.  Other health claims. Some people go gluten-free because they believe it can help control health problems such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, and weight gain. However, these claims are unproven.  Because you cut out a whole group of foods, a gluten-free diet can cause you to lose weight. However, there are easier diets to follow for weight loss. People with celiac disease often gain weight because their symptoms improve.  How it Works : On this diet, you need to learn which foods contain gluten and avoid them. This is not easy, because gluten is in many foods and food products.   Many foods are naturally gluten-free, including:  - Fruits and vegetables  - Meat, fish, poultry, and eggs\", \"x\": -0.646876335144043, \"y\": 4.849442005157471}, {\"text\": \"Do you have information about Learn to love exercise https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000764.htm Summary : You know exercise is good for you.

Keep stress from making you sick by learning healthy ways to manage it.  LEARN TO RECOGNIZE STRESS  The first step in managing stress is recognizing it in your life. Everyone feels stress in a different way. You may get angry or irritable, lose sleep, or have headaches or stomach upset. What are your signs of stress? Once you know what signals to look for, you can start to manage it.  Also identify the situations that cause you stress. These are called stressors.

Anger management can help you learn healthy ways to express and control your anger.  Understanding Anger : Anger can be triggered by feelings, people, events, situations, or memories. You may feel anger when you worry about conflicts at home. A bossy coworker or commuter traffic may make your angry.   When you feel anger, your blood pressure and heart rate go up. Certain hormone levels increase, causing a burst of energy. This allows us to react aggressively when we feel threatened.   There are always going to be things in life that make you angry. The problem is that lashing out is not a good way to react most of the time. You have little or no control over the things that cause your anger. But can you learn to control your reaction.

It is also called a breathing machine or respirator. The ventilator:   - Is attached to a computer with knobs and buttons that are controlled by a respiratory therapist, nurse, or doctor.  - Has tubes that connect to the person through a breathing tube. The breathing tube is placed in the person's mouth or in an opening through the neck into the windpipe (trachea). This opening is called a tracheostomy.  - Makes noise and has alarms that alert the health care team when something needs to be fixed or changed.  How Does Being on a Ventilator Feel? : A person receives medicine to remain comfortable while on a ventilator, especially if they have a breathing tube in their mouth. The medicine may cause people to be too sleepy to open their eyes.  People cannot talk because of the breathing tube. When they are awake enough to open their eyes and move, they can communicate in writing.  People on ventilators will have many wires and tubes on them. This may look scary, but these wires and tubes help to carefully monitor them.  Some people may have restraints. These are used to prevent them from pulling out any important tubes and wires.  Why are Ventilators Needed? : People are placed on ventilators when they cannot breathe on their own. This may be for any of the following reasons:  - To make sure the person is getting enough oxygen and is getting rid of carbon dioxide.  - After surgery, people may need a ventilator to breathe for them when they have had medicine that causes them to be sleepy and their breathing has not returned to normal.  - A person has an illness or injury and is not able to breathe normally.

Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods. However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey.

It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.  The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.  Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor and a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood.

(Also called: BWS; Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS)) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome The genetic causes of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are complex. The condition usually results from the abnormal regulation of genes in a particular region of chromosome 11. People normally inherit one copy of this chromosome from each parent. For most genes on chromosome 11, both copies of the gene are expressed, or \\\"turned on,\\\" in cells. For some genes, however, only the copy inherited from a person's father (the paternally inherited copy) is expressed. For other genes, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternally inherited copy) is expressed. These parent-specific differences in gene expression are caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. Abnormalities involving genes on chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting are responsible for most cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  At least half of all cases result from changes in a process called methylation. Methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA. In genes that undergo genomic imprinting, methylation is one way that a gene's parent of origin is marked during the formation of egg and sperm cells. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is often associated with changes in regions of DNA on chromosome 11 called imprinting centers (ICs). ICs control the methylation of several genes that are involved in normal growth, including the CDKN1C, H19, IGF2, and KCNQ1OT1 genes. Abnormal methylation disrupts the regulation of these genes, which leads to overgrowth and the other characteristic features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  About twenty percent of cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are caused by a genetic change known as paternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Paternal UPD causes people to have two active copies of paternally inherited genes rather than one active copy from the father and one inactiv\", \"x\": -1.2785639762878418, \"y\": 6.643779754638672}, {\"text\": \"Is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome inherited ?

However, parents of one child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome may be at risk of having other children with the disorder. This risk depends on the genetic cause of the condition.  Another 10 to 15 percent of people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are part of families with more than one affected family member. In most of these families, the condition appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is typically sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome inherit the genetic change from their mothers. Occasionally, a person who inherits the altered gene will not have any of the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition.  Rarely, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome results from changes in the structure of chromosome 11. Some of these chromosomal abnormalities are inherited from a parent, while others occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in the earliest stages of development before birth.)  \", \"x\": -1.4225012063980103, \"y\": 6.495397090911865}, {\"text\": \"What are the treatments for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ?

(adverse means unwanted or unexpected.) Almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.  A true drug allergy is caused by a series of chemical steps in the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.  The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. However, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE. Instead, it might produce other types of antibodies, or have other reactions that do not produce antibodies.  Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medication or vaccine.  Common allergy-causing drugs include:  -  Anticonvulsants   -  Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin)   -  Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)   -  Penicillin and related antibiotics   -  Sulfa drugs    Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered idiosyncratic. This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication. It is not due to a known chemical effect of the drug.

This affects your safety and the quality of the care you will receive there.  CHOOSING THE BEST HOSPITAL FOR SURGERY  A hospital can offer many things to improve the quality of care you receive. For example, find out if your hospital has:  - A floor or unit that does only the type of surgery you are having (For example, for hip replacement surgery, do they have a floor or unit that is used only for joint-replacement surgeries?)  - Operating rooms that are used only for your type of surgery  - Specific guidelines so that everyone who has your type of surgery receives the kind of care they need  - Enough nurses    It can also be helpful to know how many surgeries like yours have been done at the hospital you have chosen or are considering for your surgery. People who have surgery at hospitals that do more of the same type of procedure often do better.  If you are having a surgery that involves newer techniques, find out how many of these procedures your hospital has already done.

Some common quality measures include:  - Patient injuries, such as falls  - Patients who receive the wrong medicine or the wrong dosage of a medicine  - Complications, such as infections, blood clots, and pressure ulcers (bedsores)  - Readmission and death (mortality) rates    Hospitals receive scores for their quality.

It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.  Causes : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething  Home Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia.

The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom.

Their development is significantly delayed, and most affected individuals have severe to profound intellectual disability.

Ear abnormalities are common, including small holes in the skin just in front of the ears (preauricular pits or sinuses). About half of all affected infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) or a high arched palate. Males with Emanuel syndrome often have genital abnormalities.

As a result of the extra chromosome, people with Emanuel syndrome have three copies of some genes in each cell instead of the usual two copies.

However, translocations can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation.

Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.  - Read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner's manual, too.  - Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.

Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. For example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident.  - Try the seat before buying it. Install the seat in your vehicle. Put your child in the car seat. Secure the harness and buckle. Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child.  - DO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely.

How the Test is Performed : A sample of ear drainage is needed. Your health care provider will use a cotton swab to collect the sample from inside the outer ear canal. In some cases, a sample is collected from the middle ear during ear surgery.  The sample is sent to a lab and placed on a special dish (culture media).  The lab team checks the dish every day to see if bacteria, fungi, or viruses have grown. More tests may be done to look for specific substances and determine the best treatment.  How to Prepare for the Test : You do not need to prepare for this test.  How the Test will Feel : Using a cotton swab to take a sample of drainage from the outer ear is not painful. However, ear pain may be present if the ear is infected.  Ear surgery is done using general anesthesia. You will be asleep and feel no pain.  Why the Test is Performed : The test may be done if you or your child has:  - An ear infection that is not getting better with treatment  - An infection of the outer ear (otitis externa)  - An ear infection with a ruptured eardrum and draining fluid    It may also be done as a routine part of myringotomy.  Note: Ear infections are diagnosed based on symptoms rather than using a culture.  Normal Results : The test is normal if there is no growth on the culture.  Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.  What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be a sign of infection by bacteria, virus, or fungus.  The test results may show which organism is causing the infection.

(Also called: OME; Secretory otitis media; Serous otitis media; Silent otitis media; Silent ear infection; Glue ear) https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007010.htm The Eustachian tube connects the inside of the ear to the back of the throat. This tube helps drain fluid to prevent it from building up in the ear. The fluid drains from the tube and is swallowed.  Otitis media with effusion (OME) and ear infections are connected in two ways:  - After most ear infections have been treated, fluid (an effusion) remains in the middle ear for a few days or weeks.  - When the Eustachian tube is partially blocked, fluid builds up in the middle ear. Bacteria inside the ear become trapped and begin to grow. This may lead to an ear infection.    The following can cause swelling of the Eustachian tube lining that leads to increased fluid:  - Allergies  - Irritants (especially cigarette smoke)  - Respiratory infections    The following can cause the Eustachian tube to close or become blocked:  - Drinking while lying on your back  - Sudden increases in air pressure (such as descending in an airplane or on a mountain road)    Getting water in a baby's ears will not lead to a blocked tube.  OME is most common in winter or early spring, but it can occur at any time of year. It can affect people of any age. It occurs most often in children under age 2, but is rare in newborns.  Younger children get OME more often than older children or adults for several reasons:  - The tube is shorter, more horizontal, and straighter, making it easier for bacteria to enter.  - The tube is floppier, with a tinier opening that's easy to block.  - Young children get more colds because it takes time for the immune system to be able to recognize and ward off cold viruses.    The fluid in OME is often thin and watery. In the past, it was thought that the fluid got thicker the longer it was present in the ear.

Instead, they will recheck the problem in 2 to 3 months.  Some children who have had repeat ear infections may receive a small, daily dose of antibiotics to prevent new infections.  You can make the following changes to help clear up the fluid behind the eardrum:  - Avoid cigarette smoke  - Encourage infants to breastfeed  - Treat allergies by staying away from triggers (such as dust). Adults and older children may be given allergy medications.    Most often the fluid will clear on its own. You doctor may suggest watching the condition for a while to see if it is getting worse before recommending treatment.  If the fluid is still present after 6 weeks, the doctor may recommend:  - Continuing to watch the problem  - A hearing test  - A single trial of antibiotics (if they were not given earlier)    If the fluid is still present at 8 to 12 weeks, antibiotics may be tried. These medicines are not always helpful.  At some point, the child's hearing should be tested.  If there is significant hearing loss (more than 20 decibels), antibiotics or ear tubes might be needed.

(adverse means unwanted or unexpected.) Almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.  A true drug allergy is caused by a series of chemical steps in the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.  The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. However, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE. Instead, it might produce other types of antibodies, or have other reactions that do not produce antibodies.  Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medication or vaccine.  Common allergy-causing drugs include:  -  Anticonvulsants   -  Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin)   -  Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)   -  Penicillin and related antibiotics   -  Sulfa drugs    Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered idiosyncratic. This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication. It is not due to a known chemical effect of the drug.

In the kidney, 25-hydroxy vitamin D changes into an active form of the vitamin. The active form of vitamin D helps control calcium and phosphate levels in the body.  This article discusses the blood test used to measure the amount of 25-hydroxy vitamin D.  How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test : Usually you will not need to fast. However, this depends on the laboratory and the testing method used.  How the Test Will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.  Why the Test is Performed : This test is done to determine if you have too much or too little vitamin D in your blood.  Normal Results : The normal range of vitamin D is measured as nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Many experts recommend a level between 20 and 40 ng/mL. Others recommend a level between 30 and 50 ng/mL.  The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results, and whether you may need vitamin D supplements.  What Abnormal Results Mean : Lower-than-normal levels can be due to a vitamin D deficiency, which can result from:  - Lack of exposure to sunlight  - Lack of enough vitamin D in the diet  - Liver and kidney diseases  - Poor food absorption  - Use of certain medicines, including phenytoin, phenobarbital, and rifampin    Low vitamin D levels are more common in African-American children (especially in the winter), as well as in infants who are breastfed only.

But changing or stopping your medicine on your own can be dangerous. It could make your condition worse.  Learn how to talk to your doctor and pharmacist about your medicine.

You may feel like you do not need to take it anymore.  If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you will not get its full effect, or your condition can get worse. Here are some examples:  - When you take antibiotics, you will feel better in 1 to 2 days. If you stop taking the medicine early, you may get sick again.  - If you are taking a steroid pack for your asthma, you will feel better quickly.

In addition, there is a higher incidence of pneumonia in children with Down syndrome than in the general population. Children with Down syndrome have developmental delay. They are often slow to turn over, sit, and stand. Developmental delay may be related to the child's weak muscle tone. Development of speech and language may also take longer than expected. Children with Down syndrome may take longer than other children to reach their developmental milestones, but many of these milestones will eventually be met. Adults with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease, a brain disorder that results in a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. Although Alzheimer disease is usually a disorder that occurs in older adults, about half of adults with Down syndrome develop this condition by age 50.

(Also called: Trisomy 21; Down's syndrome) https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10247/down-syndrome What causes Down syndrome? There are 3 possible genetic causes of Down syndrome: Trisomy 21. Most often, Down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome 21 in all cells of the affected person.  In these cases, the chromosome 21 pair fails to separate during the formation of an egg (or sperm); this is called \\\"nondisjunction.\\\" When the egg with 2 copies of chromosome 21 unites with a normal sperm with one copy of chromosome 21 to form an embryo, the resulting embryo has 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. The extra chromosome is then copied in every cell of the baby's body, causing the features of Down syndrome. The cause of nondisjunction is unknown, but research has shown that it happens more often as women age. Nondisjunction is not known to be caused by anything in the environment or anything that parents do (or don't do) before or during pregnancy. Mosaic trisomy 21. In about 1-2% of cases, only some of the cells in a person's body have an extra chromosome 21; this is called \\\"mosaic trisomy 21\\\".  In this situation, the fertilized egg may have the right number of chromosomes, but due to a cell division error early in the development of the embryo, some cells \\\"acquire\\\" an extra chromosome 21. A person with mosaic trisomy 21 typically has 46 chromosomes in some cells, and 47 chromosomes (with the extra chromosome 21) in others. The features and severity in people with mosaic trisomy 21 may vary widely.  Translocation trisomy 21. About 3-4% of people with Down syndrome have cells that contain 46 chromosomes; however, there is extra chromosome 21 material attached (translocated ) onto another chromosome.  For parents of a child with Down syndrome due to a translocation, there may be an increased chance of Down syndrome in future pregnancies. This is because one of the two parents may be a carrier of a balanced translocation. However, not all parents of people with translo\", \"x\": -1.8236823081970215, \"y\": 7.0981855392456055}, {\"text\": \"What are the genetic changes related to Down syndrome ? (Also called: 47,XX,+21; 47,XY,+21; Down's syndrome; trisomy 21; trisomy G) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/down-syndrome Most cases of Down syndrome result from trisomy 21, which means each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two copies.  Less commonly, Down syndrome occurs when part of chromosome 21 becomes attached (translocated) to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in a parent or very early in fetal development. Affected people have two normal copies of chromosome 21 plus extra material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome, resulting in three copies of genetic material from chromosome 21. Affected individuals with this genetic change are said to have translocation Down syndrome.  A very small percentage of people with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21 in only some of the body's cells. In these people, the condition is called mosaic Down syndrome.  Researchers believe that having extra copies of genes on chromosome 21 disrupts the course of normal development, causing the characteristic features of Down syndrome and the increased risk of health problems associated with this condition.)  \", \"x\": -1.7334082126617432, \"y\": 6.963769435882568}, {\"text\": \"Is Down syndrome inherited ?

When the condition is caused by trisomy 21, the chromosomal abnormality occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells in a parent. The abnormality usually occurs in egg cells, but it occasionally occurs in sperm cells. An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of chromosome 21. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 21 in each of the body's cells.  People with translocation Down syndrome can inherit the condition from an unaffected parent. The parent carries a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 21 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. However, as this translocation is passed to the next generation, it can become unbalanced. People who inherit an unbalanced translocation involving chromosome 21 may have extra genetic material from chromosome 21, which causes Down syndrome.  Like trisomy 21, mosaic Down syndrome is not inherited. It occurs as a random event during cell division early in fetal development. As a result, some of the body's cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 21, and other cells have three copies of this chromosome.)  \", \"x\": -1.8284366130828857, \"y\": 7.02878475189209}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Dementia - home care ?

MID usually affects people between ages 55 and 75. More men than women have vascular dementia.  Vascular dementia is caused by a series of small strokes.  - A stroke is an interruption in or blockage of the blood supply to any part of the brain. A stroke is also called an infarct. Multi-infarct means that more than one area in the brain has been injured due to a lack of blood.  - If blood flow is stopped for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing permanent damage.  - When these strokes affect a small area, there may be no symptoms of a stroke. These are called silent strokes. Over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged, the symptoms of dementia appear.  - Not all strokes are silent. Larger strokes that affect strength, sensation, or other brain and nervous system (neurologic) function can also lead to dementia.    Risk factors for vascular dementia include:  - Diabetes  - Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis)  - High blood pressure (hypertension)  - Smoking  - Stroke   Symptoms of dementia may also be caused by other types of disorders of the brain.

People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntingtons disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brains oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems.

Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30times or more an hour. Typically, normal breathing then starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound.                  Sleep apnea usually is a chronic (ongoing) condition that disrupts your sleep. When your breathing pauses or becomes shallow, youll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep.                  As a result, the quality of your sleep is poor, which makes you tired during the day. Sleep apnea is a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness.                  Overview                  Sleep apnea often goes undiagnosed. Doctors usually can't detect the condition during routine office visits. Also, no blood test can help diagnose the condition.                  Most people who have sleep apnea don't know they have it because it only occurs during sleep. A family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea.                  The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In this condition, the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. This causes shallow breathing or breathing pauses.                  When you try to breathe, any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring. Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight, but it can affect anyone.

People with sleep apnea will partially awaken as they struggle to breathe, but in the morning they will not be aware of the disturbances in their sleep. The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), caused by relaxation of soft tissue in the back of the throat that blocks the passage of air. Central sleep apnea (CSA) is caused by irregularities in the brains normal signals to breathe. Most people with sleep apnea will have a combination of both types. The hallmark symptom of the disorder is excessive daytime sleepiness. Additional symptoms of sleep apnea include restless sleep, loud snoring (with periods of silence followed by gasps), falling asleep during the day, morning headaches, trouble concentrating, irritability, forgetfulness, mood or behavior changes, anxiety, and depression.

It may be done to treat mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or severe snoring.  Description : Surgery known as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) removes soft tissue at the back of the throat. This includes:  - All or part of the uvula (the soft flap of tissue that hangs down at the back of the mouth).  - Parts of the soft palate and tissue at the sides of the throat.  - Tonsils and adenoids, if they are still there.  Why the Procedure is Performed : Your doctor may recommend this surgery if you have mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  - Try lifestyle changes, such as weight loss or changing your sleep position.  - Most experts recommend trying to use CPAP or an oral device to treat OSA first.    Your doctor may recommend this surgery to treat severe snoring, even if you do not have OSA.

It involves the child leaving the environment and activities where the inappropriate behavior occurred, and going to a specific place for a set amount of time. During time out, the child is expected to be quiet and think about their behavior.  Time out is an effective disciplinary technique that does not use physical punishment. Professionals report that NOT physically punishing children may help them learn that physical violence or inflicting physical pain does NOT bring desired results.  Children learn to avoid time out by stopping the behaviors that have caused time outs, or warnings of time outs, in the past.  Information : HOW TO USE TIME OUT  - Find a place in your home that will be suitable for time out. A chair in the hallway or a corner will work. It should be a place that is not too closed-off, dark, or scary. It should also be a place that has no potential for fun, such as in front of a TV or in a play area.  - Get a timer that makes a loud noise, and establish the amount of time to be spent in time out. It is generally recommended to do 1 minute per year of age, but no more than 5 minutes.  - Once your child shows bad behavior, explain clearly what the unacceptable behavior is, and tell your child to stop it. Warn them what will happen if they don't stop the behavior -- sitting in the chair for a time out. Be ready with praise if your child stops the behavior.  - If the behavior does not stop, tell your child to go to time out. Tell them why -- make sure they understand the rules. Only say it once, and do not lose your temper. By yelling and nagging, you are giving your child (and the behavior) too much attention. You may guide your child to the time out spot with as much physical force as necessary (even picking your child up and placing them in the chair). Never spank or physically hurt your child.

It is classified as an autoimmune disorder because it results from a malfunctioning immune system that attacks the adrenal glands. As a result, the production of several hormones is disrupted, which affects many body systems.  The signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease can begin at any time, although they most commonly begin between ages 30 and 50. Common features of this condition include extreme tiredness (fatigue), nausea, decreased appetite, and weight loss. In addition, many affected individuals have low blood pressure (hypotension), which can lead to dizziness when standing up quickly; muscle cramps; and a craving for salty foods. A characteristic feature of autoimmune Addison disease is abnormally dark areas of skin (hyperpigmentation), especially in regions that experience a lot of friction, such as the armpits, elbows, knuckles, and palm creases. The lips and the inside lining of the mouth can also be unusually dark. Because of an imbalance of hormones involved in development of sexual characteristics, women with this condition may lose their underarm and pubic hair.  Other signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease include low levels of sugar (hypoglycemia) and sodium (hyponatremia) and high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) in the blood. Affected individuals may also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and an increase in the number of white blood cells (lymphocytosis), particularly those known as eosinophils (eosinophilia).

A combination of environmental and genetic factors plays a role in the disorder, and changes in multiple genes are thought to affect the risk of developing the condition.  The genes that have been associated with autoimmune Addison disease participate in the body's immune response. The most commonly associated genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. The most well-known risk factor for autoimmune Addison disease is a variant of the HLA-DRB1 gene called HLA-DRB1*04:04. This and other disease-associated HLA gene variants likely contribute to an inappropriate immune response that leads to autoimmune Addison disease, although the mechanism is unknown.  Normally, the immune system responds only to proteins made by foreign invaders, not to the body's own proteins. In autoimmune Addison disease, however, an immune response is triggered by a normal adrenal gland protein, typically a protein called 21-hydroxylase. This protein plays a key role in producing certain hormones in the adrenal glands. The prolonged immune attack triggered by 21-hydroxylase damages the adrenal glands (specifically the outer layers of the glands known, collectively, as the adrenal cortex), preventing hormone production. A shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) disrupts several normal functions in the body, leading to hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, muscle cramps, skin hyperpigmenta\", \"x\": -1.1338359117507935, \"y\": 5.702469348907471}, {\"text\": \"Is autoimmune Addison disease inherited ?

This makes it hard for your health care provider to know if you really have one of these diseases, and if so, which one. Getting a diagnosis can be frustrating and stressful. Often, the first symptoms are fatigue, muscle aches and a low fever. The classic sign of an autoimmune disease is inflammation, which can cause redness, heat, pain and swelling.

It can also be caused byinfection or exposure to toxins. In many cases, the cause is unknown.  The most common form of uveitis is anterior uveitis. This involves inflammation in the front part of the eye. It is often called iritis because it usually only affects the iris, the colored part of the eye. The inflammation may be linked with autoimmune diseases, but most cases occur in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people.  Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the uvea. It involves primarily the choroid, which is a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle part of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis. You may develop this condition if you have had a body-wide (systemic) infection or if you have an autoimmune disease.  Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. This inflammation affects the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid. Pars planitis most often occurs in young men. It is generally not associated with any other disease. However, it may be linked to Crohn's disease and possibly multiple sclerosis.

A small piece of tissue or the entire abnormal area is removed and sent to the lab to be tested if:  - Abnormalities of the bladder are found during this exam  - A tumor is seen  How to Prepare for the Test : You must sign an informed consent form before you have a bladder biopsy. In most cases, you are asked to urinate just before the procedure. You may also be asked to take an antibiotic before the procedure.  For infants and children, the preparation you can provide for this test depends on your child's age, previous experiences, and level of trust. For general information regarding how you can prepare your child, see the following topics:  - Infant test or procedure preparation (birth to 1 year)  - Toddler test or procedure preparation (1 to 3 years)  - Preschooler test or procedure preparation (3 to 6 years)  - School age test or procedure preparation (6 to 12 years)  - Adolescent test or procedure preparation (12 to 18 years)  How the Test will Feel : There may be slight discomfort as the cystoscope (a lighted instrument used to look at the bladder) is passed through your urethra into your bladder. You will feel discomfort that is similar to a strong urge to urinate when the fluid has filled your bladder.  You may feel a pinch during the biopsy. There may be a burning sensation when the blood vessels are sealed to stop bleeding (cauterized).  After the cystoscope is removed, your urethra may be sore. You may feel a burning sensation during urination for a day or two.  If the biopsy needs to be taken from a large area, you may need general or spinal anesthesia before the procedure.

(Also called: Cancer of the bladder; Malignant tumor of urinary bladder; Urinary bladder cancer) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/bladder-cancer Bladder cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the bladder become abnormal and multiply without control or order. The bladder is a hollow, muscular organ in the lower abdomen that stores urine until it is ready to be excreted from the body. The most common type of bladder cancer begins in cells lining the inside of the bladder and is called transitional cell carcinoma (TCC).  Bladder cancer may cause blood in the urine, pain during urination, frequent urination, or the feeling that one needs to urinate without results.

(Also called: Cancer of the bladder; Malignant tumor of urinary bladder; Urinary bladder cancer) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/bladder-cancer As with most cancers, the exact causes of bladder cancer are not known; however, many risk factors are associated with this disease. Many of the major risk factors are environmental, such as smoking and exposure to certain industrial chemicals. Studies suggest that chronic bladder inflammation, a parasitic infection called schistosomiasis, and some medications used to treat cancer are other environmental risk factors associated with bladder cancer.  Genetic factors are also likely to play an important role in determining bladder cancer risk. Researchers have studied the effects of mutations in several genes, including FGFR3, RB1, HRAS, TP53, and TSC1, on the formation and growth of bladder tumors. Each of these genes plays a critical role in regulating cell division by preventing cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Alterations in these genes may help explain why some bladder cancers grow and spread more rapidly than others.  Deletions of part or all of chromosome 9 are common events in bladder tumors. Researchers believe that several genes that control cell growth and division are probably located on chromosome 9. They are working to determine whether a loss of these genes plays a role in the development and progression of bladder cancer.  Most of the genetic changes associated with bladder cancer develop in bladder tissue during a person's lifetime, rather than being inherited from a parent.

Saturated fat is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.                  Trans fatty acids (trans fats) raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Trans fats are made when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to harden it.

The key functions affected in high blood pressure include -  kidney fluid and salt balances  -  the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system   - the sympathetic nervous system activity   - blood vessel structure and function. kidney fluid and salt balances the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system the sympathetic nervous system activity blood vessel structure and function. Kidney Fluid and Salt Balances The kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and eliminating potassium. Imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure. Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. Angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. Increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure. Sympathetic Nervous System Activity The sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure. Blood Vessel Structure and Function Changes in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure. The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure. Genetic Causes High blood pressure often runs in families. Years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure. However, known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3 percent of all cases.

BACKGROUND  The heart has two sides. The right side pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. The left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.  Blood flows out of the heart through arteries, which branch out and get smaller and smaller as they go into the tissues. In the tissues, they become tiny capillaries.  Capillaries are where the blood gives up oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, and receives carbon dioxide and wastes back from the tissues. Then, the vessels begin to collect together into larger and larger veins, which return blood to the heart.      Watch this video about:   Blood flow     AGING CHANGES  Heart:  - The heart has a natural pacemaker system that controls the heartbeat. Some of the pathways of this system may develop fibrous tissue and fat deposits. The natural pacemaker (the SA node) loses some of its cells. These changes may result in a slightly slower heart rate.  - A slight increase in the size of the heart, especially the left ventricle, is not uncommon. The heart wall thickens, so the amount of blood that the chamber can hold may actually decrease despite the increased overall heart size. The heart may fill more slowly.  - Heart changes cause the ECG of a normal, healthy older person to be slightly different than the ECG of a healthy younger adult. Abnormal rhythms (arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation, are more common in older people. They may be caused by heart disease.  - Normal changes in the heart include deposits of the \\\"aging pigment,\\\" lipofuscin. The heart muscle cells degenerate slightly.

Before birth, your doctor will use ultrasound to measure the size of the baby's head, abdomen, and thigh bone. This helps determine how well the baby is growing in the womb.   After birth, gestational age can be measured by looking at the baby's weight, length, head circumference, vital signs, reflexes, muscle tone, posture, and the condition of the skin and hair. The baby's developmental gestational age may not be the same as the calendar age. For example, an infant born at 36 weeks may actually have a developmental gestational age of 38 weeks. This baby may be more like a full-term infant than a baby born prematurely.  Determining a babys gestational age is important.

Information : PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT  School-age children usually have smooth and strong motor skills. However, their coordination (especially eye-hand), endurance, balance, and physical abilities vary.  Fine motor skills may also vary widely. These skills can affect a child's ability to write neatly, dress appropriately, and perform certain chores, such as making beds or doing dishes.  There will be big differences in height, weight, and build among children of this age range. It is important to remember that genetic background, as well as nutrition and exercise, may affect a child's growth.  A sense of body image begins developing around age 6. Sedentary habits in school-age children are linked to a risk for obesity and heart disease in adults. Children in this age group should get 1 hour of physical activity per day.  There can also be a big difference in the age at which children begin to develop secondary sexual characteristics. For girls, secondary sex characteristics include:  - Breast development  - Underarm and pubic hair growth    For boys, they include:  - Growth of underarm, chest, and pubic hair  - Growth of testicles and penis    SCHOOL  By age 5, most children are ready to start learning in a school setting. The first few years focus on learning the fundamentals.   In 3rd grade, the focus becomes more complex. Reading becomes more about the content than identifying letters and words.   An ability to pay attention is important for success both at school and at home. A 6-year-old should be able to focus on a task for at least 15 minutes. By age 9, a child should be able to focus attention for about an hour.  It is important for the child to learn how to deal with failure or frustration without losing self-esteem.

Shingles is a painful skin rash, often with blisters. It is also called Herpes Zoster, or just Zoster.  A shingles rash usually appears on one side of the face or body and lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. Its main symptom is pain, which can be quite severe. Other symptoms of shingles can include fever, headache, chills and upset stomach. Very rarely, a shingles infection can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitits) or death.  For about 1 person in 5, severe pain can continue even long after the rash clears up. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia.  Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox.  Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. The virus stays in your body, and can cause shingles many years later.  You can't catch shingles from another person with shingles. However, a person who has never had chickenpox (or chickenpox vaccine) could get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This is not very common.  Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in younger people. It is also more common in people whose immune systems are weakened because of a disease such as cancer, or drugs such as steroids or chemotherapy.  At least 1 million people a year in the United States get shingles. Shingles vaccine  A vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2006. In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated.  A single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older.

In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages, it is most common in 60- to 80-year-olds.

It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (Another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) Once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain.

The first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain (which can be severe), or sometimes numbness or itch,generally on one side of the body. After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters, similar to chickenpox, appears in one area on one side of the body. Shingles pain can be mild or intense. Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze. The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles. Scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicella-zoster virus,leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system. When the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin.

You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething  Home Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby.

The signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals.  Poor muscle tone is commonly seen in individuals with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome and contributes to delayed development and impairment of motor skills, including sitting and walking.  Babies with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome often have trouble feeding due to weak facial muscles that impair sucking and swallowing; many also have backflow of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux). These feeding problems may make it difficult for them to gain weight.  Intellectual disability in isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome can range from mild to profound. Speech is usually delayed and often remains absent or impaired. Behavioral difficulties often associated with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome include hyperactivity, anxiety, and frustration leading to tantrums. Other behaviors resemble features of autistic spectrum disorders, such as repeating the words of others (echolalia), difficulty with changes in routine, and problems with social interaction.  About two-thirds of people with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome have seizures. In more than half of affected individuals, the seizures begin in the first year of life.  About 40 percent of individuals with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome are born with eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Hearing loss in childhood is common and is usually caused by fluid buildup in the middle ear. This hearing loss is often temporary. However, if left untreated during early childhood, the hearing loss can interfere with language development and worsen the speech problems associated with this disorder.

SCREENING TESTS  These are tests that check if you've been infected with HIV. The most common tests are described below.  An antibody test (also called immunoassay) checks for antibodiesto the HIV virus. Your health care provider may order the test for you to have done at a lab. Or, you may have it done at a testing center or use a home kit. These tests can detect antibodies starting a few weeks after youre infected with the virus. Antibody tests can be done using:  - Blood -- This test is done by drawing blood from a vein, or by a finger prick. A blood test is the most accurate because blood has a higher level of antibodies than other body fluids.  - Oral fluid -- This test checks for antibodies in the cells of the mouth. It is done by swabbing the gums and inside cheeks. This test is less accurate than the blood test.  - Urine -- This test checks for antibodies in the urine. This test is also less accurate than the blood test.   An antigen test checks your blood for an HIV antigen, called p24. When you're first infected with HIV, and before your body has a chance to make antibodies to the virus, your blood has a high level of p24. The p24 antigen test is accurate 11 days to 1 month after getting infected. This test is usually not used by itself to screen for HIV infection.  An antibody-antigen blood test checks for levels of both HIV antibodies and the p24 antigen. This test can detect the virus as early as 3 weeks after getting infected.  FOLLOW-UP TESTS  A follow-up test is also called a confirmatory test. It is usually done when the screening test is positive.

Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.

These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your \\\"blood alcohol level.\\\" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50\", \"x\": 5.924346923828125, \"y\": 4.507956027984619}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Dementia - keeping safe in the home ? https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000031.htm It is important to make sure the homes of people who have dementia are safe for them.)  \", \"x\": -0.5062140822410583, \"y\": 2.8838460445404053}, {\"text\": \"Do you have information about Drinking water safely during cancer treatment https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000060.htm Summary : During and right after your cancer treatment, your body cannot protect itself against infections.

Ask if they test the water every day for the kind of germs that can give you an infection -- germs are called coliforms.  Well water : Boil water from a private well or a small community well before you drink it or use it for cooking or brushing your teeth.  Running well water through a filter or adding chlorine to it does not make it safe to use. Test your well water at least once a year for coliform germs that may cause an infection. Test your water more often if coliforms are found in it or if there is any question about the safety of your water.

It opens up many options for a young person, but it also carries risks. Young people between ages 15 and 24 have the highest rate of auto-related deaths. The rate is the highest for young men.   Parents and teens should be aware of problem areas and take steps to avoid hazards.  Information : Make a Commitment to Safety  Teens also need to commit to being safe and responsible drivers in order to improve the odds in their favor.  - Reckless driving is still a danger to teens -- even with automobile safety features.  - All new drivers should take a driver's education course. These courses can reduce risk for crashes.    Drivers and passengers should use automobile safety features at all times. These include: seat belts, shoulder straps, and headrests. Only drive cars that have air bags, padded dashes, safety glass, collapsible steering columns, and anti-lock brakes.  Auto accidents are also a leading cause of death in infants and children. Infants and young children should be properly buckled into a child safety seat of the right size that is correctly installed in the vehicle.  Avoid Distracted Driving   Distractions are a problem for all drivers. Do not use cell phones for talking, texting, or email when you are driving.   - Mobile phones should be turned off when driving so you are not tempted to make calls, send or read texts, or answer the phone.  - If phones are left on for emergency use, pull off of the road before answering or texting.    Other tips include:  - Avoid putting on makeup while driving, even when stopped at a light or stop sign, it can be dangerous.  - Finish eating before starting your car and driving.

Information : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober.

This opening is called a hernia. It is a rare type of birth defect. (Congenital means the problem is present at birth.)  Description : Before this surgery, nearly all infants need a breathing device to improve their oxygen levels.  The surgery is done while your child is under general anesthesia (asleep and not able to feel pain). The surgeon makes a cut (incision) in the belly under the upper ribs. This allows the organs in the area to be reached. The surgeon gently pulls these organs down into place through the opening in the diaphragm and into the abdominal cavity.  The surgeon repairs the hole in the diaphragm. If the hole is small, it may be repaired with stitches. In most cases, a piece of plastic patch is used to cover the hole.  Why the Procedure is Performed : The diaphragm is a muscle. It is important for breathing. It separates the chest cavity (where the heart and lungs are) from the belly area.   In a child born with a diaphragmatic hernia, the diaphragm muscle is not completely formed. So, organs from the belly (stomach, spleen, liver, and intestines) may go up into the chest cavity where the lungs are. This prevents the lung(s) from growing normally. The lungs stay too small for babies to breathe on their own when they are born.   A diaphragmatic hernia can be life-threatening. Surgery to repair it must be done in the first few days or weeks of a child's life.  Risks : Risks for this surgery include:   - Breathing problems, which may be severe  - Bleeding  - Collapsed lung  - Lung problems that do not go away  - Infection  - Reactions to medicines  Before the Procedure : Infants with a diaphragmatic hernia are admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

Because the diaphragm is not fully developed, organs, such as the stomach, small intestine, spleen, part of the liver, and the kidney, may take up part of the chest cavity.  CDH most often involves only one side of the diaphragm. It is more common on the left side. Often, the lung tissue and blood vessels in the area do not develop normally either.

(Also called: congenital diaphragmatic defect) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth.  In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons.  Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare.)  \", \"x\": -2.2167246341705322, \"y\": 5.949976444244385}, {\"text\": \"What are the genetic changes related to congenital diaphragmatic hernia ?

Talk about things that your adolescent may enjoy after the test, such as feeling better or going home. Rewards such as shopping trips or movies may be helpful if the adolescent is able to do them.  Tell your adolescent as much as you can about the equipment that will be used for the test.

Learning how to safely handle sharps is important to prevent accidental needlesticks and cuts.  Preventing Injuries : Before you use a sharp object, such as a needle or scalpel, make sure you have all the items you need close by. This includes items like alcohol swabs, gauze, and bandages.  Also, know where the sharps disposal container is. Check to make sure there is enough room in the container for your object to fit. It should not be more than two-thirds full.  Some needles have a protective device, such as a needle shield, sheath, or blunting, that you activate after you remove the needle from the person. This allows you to handle the needle safely, without the risk of exposing yourself to blood or body fluids. If you are using this kind of needle, make sure you know how it works before you use it.  Follow these guidelines when you work with sharps.  - DO NOT uncover or unwrap the sharp object until it is time to use it.  - Keep the object pointed away from yourself and other people at all times.  - Never recap or bend a sharp object.  - Keep your fingers away from the tip of the object.  - If the object is reusable, put it in a secure, closed container after you use it.  - Never hand a sharp object to someone else or put it on a tray for another person to pick up.  - Tell the people you are working with when you plan to set the object down or pick it up.  Sharps Disposal : Make sure the disposal container is made for disposing of sharp objects. Replace containers when they are two-thirds full.  Other important tips include:  - Never put your fingers into the sharps container.  - If the needle has tubing attached to it, hold the needle and the tubing when you put it in the sharps container.  - Sharps containers should be at eye level and within your reach.  - If a needle is st\", \"x\": 2.2551372051239014, \"y\": 8.798175811767578}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Infant test/procedure preparation ?

The most important way you can help your infant through this procedure is by being there and showing you care.  Crying is a normal response to the strange environment, unfamiliar people, restraints, and separation from you. Your infant will cry more for these reasons than because the test or procedure is uncomfortable.  WHY RESTRAINTS?  Infants lack the physical control, coordination, and ability to follow commands that older children usually have. Restraints may be used during a procedure or other situation to ensure your infant's safety. For example, in order to get clear test results on an x-ray, there cannot be any movement. Your infant may be restrained by hand or with physical devices.  If blood needs to be taken or an IV started, restraints are important in preventing injury to your infant. If your infant moves while the needle is being inserted, the needle could damage a blood vessel, bone, tissue, or nerves.  Your provider will use every means to ensure the safety and comfort of your baby. Beside restraints, other measures include medications, observation, and monitors.  DURING THE PROCEDURE  Your presence helps your infant during the procedure, especially if the procedure allows you to maintain physical contact. If the procedure is performed at the hospital or your health care provider's office, you will likely be able to be present.  If you are not asked to be by your infant's side and would like to be, ask your provider if this is possible. If you think you may become ill or anxious, consider keeping your distance, but staying in your infant's line of vision. If you are not able to be present, leaving a familiar object with your infant may be comforting.

It can also make them less likely to cry and resist the procedure. Research shows that lowering anxiety can decrease the sensation of pain people feel during uncomfortable procedures. Even so, being prepared may not change the fact that your child will feel some discomfort or pain.  Before the test, understand that your child will probably cry. Demonstrate in advance what will happen during the test to learn about your child's fears and concerns. Using a doll or other object to act out the test may reveal worries your child may not be able to talk about, and may reduce your child's anxiety.  Most people are frightened of the unknown. It helps if your child knows what to expect. If your child's fears are not realistic, explaining what will actually happen can help. If your child is worried about a part of the test, do not minimize this concern. Reassure your child that you will be there to help as much as you can.  Make sure your child understands that the procedure is not a punishment. Preschool-age children may believe that the pain they feel is a punishment for something they did.  The most important way you can help your child is to prepare properly, and provide support and comfort around the time of the procedure.

Shingles is a painful skin rash, often with blisters. It is also called Herpes Zoster, or just Zoster.  A shingles rash usually appears on one side of the face or body and lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. Its main symptom is pain, which can be quite severe. Other symptoms of shingles can include fever, headache, chills and upset stomach. Very rarely, a shingles infection can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitits) or death.  For about 1 person in 5, severe pain can continue even long after the rash clears up. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia.  Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox.  Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. The virus stays in your body, and can cause shingles many years later.  You can't catch shingles from another person with shingles. However, a person who has never had chickenpox (or chickenpox vaccine) could get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This is not very common.  Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in younger people. It is also more common in people whose immune systems are weakened because of a disease such as cancer, or drugs such as steroids or chemotherapy.

But it can become active again. Somehow, the virus gets a signal that your immunity has become weakened. This triggers the reactivation. When the virus becomes active again, it follows a nerve path called a dermatome. The nerve path begins at specific points in the spine, continues around one side of the body, and surfaces at the nerve endings in the skin. The pattern of the rash reflects the location of that nerve path. Risk Factors The leading risk factor for shingles is a history of having had chickenpox. One out of every five people who have had chickenpox is likely to get shingles. Another risk factor is aging. As we age, our natural immunity gradually loses its ability to protect against infection. The shingles virus can take advantage of this and become active again. Conditions that weaken the immune system can also put people at risk for shingles. Shingles is especially dangerous for anyone who has had cancer, radiation treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, or a transplant operation. Stress is another factor that may contribute to outbreaks. While stress alone does not cause the outbreaks, shingles often occurs in people who have recently had a stressful event in their lives. Most cases of shingles occur in adults. Only about 5 percent of cases occur in children. With children, immune deficiency is the primary risk factor, but children who had chickenpox before they were one year old may also get shingles before they become adults. There have been studies of adults who had chickenpox as children and were later exposed to children who had chickenpox. Interestingly, that exposure apparently boosted the adult's immunity, wh\", \"x\": 2.230098009109497, \"y\": 12.204333305358887}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Shingles ?

Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment found in bile, a fluid made by the liver.  Bilirubin can also be measured with a urine test.  How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test : You should not eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the test. Your health care provider may instruct you to stop taking medicines that affect the test.  Many drugs may change the bilirubin level in your blood. Make sure your provider knows which medicines you are taking.  Why the Test is Performed : A small amount of older red blood cells are replaced by new blood cells every day. Bilirubin is left after these older blood cells are removed. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool.  A high level of bilirubin in the blood can lead to jaundice. Jaundice is a yellow color in the skin, mucus membranes, or eyes.  Jaundice is the most common reason to check bilirubin level. The test will likely be ordered when:  - The provider is concerned about a newborn's jaundice (most newborns have some jaundice)  - Jaundice develops in older infants, children, and adults   A bilirubin test is also ordered when the provider suspects a person has liver or gallbladder problems.  Normal Results : It is normal to have some bilirubin in the blood. A normal level is:  - Direct (also called conjugated) bilirubin: 0 to 0.3 mg/dL  - Total bilirubin: 0.3 to 1.9 mg/dL   Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

Itis a lifesaving procedure that is done when someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after anelectric shock, drowning, or heart attack. CPR involves:  - Rescue breathing, which provides oxygen to a person's lungs.  - Chest compressions, which keep the person's blood circulating.   Permanent brain damage or death can occur within minutes if a person's blood flow stops. Therefore, you must continue CPR until the person's heartbeat and breathing return, or trained medical help arrives.  Considerations : CPR is best done by someone trained in an accredited CPR course. The procedures described here are NOT a substitute for CPR training. The newest techniques emphasize compression over rescue breathing and airway management, reversing a long-standing practice. See www.americanheart.org for classes near you.  Time is very important when an unconscious person is not breathing. Permanent brain damage begins after only 4 minutes without oxygen, and death can occur as soon as 4 to 6 minutes later.  Machines called automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be found in many public places, and are available for home use. These machines have pads or paddles to place on the chest during a life-threatening emergency. They automatically check the heart rhythm and give a sudden shock if, and only if, that shock is needed to get the heart back into the right rhythm. When using an AED, follow the instructions exactly.

This development continues until the 20th week of pregnancy.  The development is a complex process. Many different things can interrupt the process. How severe your baby's problem is depends on when the interruption occurred. In general, the earlier development problems occur in the womb, the more serious the problem.  Problems in the development of a girl's reproductive organs may be caused by:  - Broken or missing genes (genetic defect)  - Use of certain drugs during pregnancy   For example, some babies may have a genetic defect that prevents their body from producing a substance called 21-hydroxylase. If a developing baby girl lacks this substance, she will be born with a uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, but her external genitals will look like those found on boys. See: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia  Certain drugs that the mother takes can pass into the baby's bloodstream and interfere with organ development. One drug known to do this is diethylstilbestrol (DES). Doctors once prescribed this medicine to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage and early labor. However, scientists learned that baby girls born to women who took this drug had an abnormally shaped uterus. The drug also increased the daughters' chances of developing a rare form of vaginal cancer.  Sometimes, a developmental disorder can be seen as soon as the baby is born. It may cause life-threatening conditions in the newborn. Other times, the condition is not diagnosed until the girl is older.  The reproductive tract develops close to the urinary tract and kidneys. It also develops at the same time as several other organs.

This condition is associated with the presence of three abnormal immune proteins (antibodies) in the blood: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I. Antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but the antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome attack normal human proteins. When these antibodies attach (bind) to proteins, the proteins change shape and bind to other molecules and receptors on the surface of cells. Binding to cells, particularly immune cells, turns on (activates) the blood clotting pathway and other immune responses.  The production of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I may coincide with exposure to foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, that are similar to normal human proteins. Exposure to these foreign invaders may cause the body to produce antibodies to fight the infection, but because the invaders are so similar to the body's own proteins, the antibodies also attack the human proteins.

Others believe that the immune system makes antibodies in response to blood clots damaging the blood vessels.)  \", \"x\": -1.4536293745040894, \"y\": 5.479442596435547}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Antiphospholipid Syndrome ? http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/antiphosphlipid/antiphospholipid.htm Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder caused when antibodies -- immune system cells that fight off bacteria and viruses -- mistakenly attack healthy body tissues and organs. In APS, specific antibodies activate the inner lining of blood vessels, which leads to the formation of blood clots in arteries or veins. APS is sometimes called sticky blood syndrome, because of the increased tendency to form blood clots in the veins and arteries. The symptoms of APS are due to the abnormal blood clotting. Clots can develop in the veins of the legs and lungs, or in the placenta of pregnant women. One of the most serious complications of APS occurs when a clot forms in the brain and causes a stroke. Other neurological symptoms include chronic headaches, dementia (similar to the dementia of Alzheimers disease), and seizures. Infrequently, individuals will develop chorea (a movement disorder in which the body and limbs writhe uncontrollably), cognitive dysfunction (such as poor memory), transverse myelitis, depression or psychosis, optic neuropathy, or sudden hearing loss. In pregnant women, clots in the placenta can cause miscarriages. APS is diagnosed by the presence of a positive antiphospholipid antibody and either a history of blood clots in an artery or vein or a history of multiple miscarriages or other pregnancy problems. Some individuals will have a characteristic lacy, net-like red rash called livedo reticularis over their wrists and knees.)  \", \"x\": -1.4597342014312744, \"y\": 5.523139953613281}, {\"text\": \"What are the treatments for Antiphospholipid Syndrome ? http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/antiphosphlipid/antiphospholipid.htm The main goal of treatment is to thin the blood to reduce clotting.

The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located inside the front of the lower neck.  How the Test is Performed : This test may be done in the health care provider's office or in a hospital. Numbing medicine (anesthesia) may or may not be used because the needle is very thin.  You lie on your back with a pillow under your shoulders and your neck extended. The biopsy site is cleaned. A thin needle is inserted into the thyroid, and a sample of thyroid cells and fluid are removed. The needle is then taken out.  Pressureis applied to the biopsy site to stop any bleeding. The siteis thencovered with a bandage.  How to Prepare for the Test : Tell your health care provider if you have drug allergies, bleeding problems, or are pregnant.

Ovulation occurs about 2 weeks before the next menstrual cycle (period) starts. Therefore, if a woman gets her period every 28 days the couple should have sex at least every 3 days between the 10th and 18th day after her period starts.

The lymph nodes are small glands that make white blood cells (lymphocytes), which fight infection. Lymph nodes may trap the germs that are causing an infection. Canceroften spreads to lymph nodes.  How the Test is Performed : A lymph node biopsy is done in an operating room in a hospital. Or, it is done at an outpatient surgical center. The biopsy may be done in different ways.  An open biopsy is surgery to remove all or part of the lymph node:   - You lie on the examination table. You may be given medicine to calm you and make you sleepy.  - The biopsy site is cleansed.  - The health care provider injects a local anesthetic (numbing medication) into the area. Sometimes, general anesthesia is used, which means you are asleep and pain-free.  - A small surgical cut (incision)is made. The lymph node or part of the node is removed.   - Theincision is closed with stitches and a bandage is applied.  - An open biopsy may take 30to 45 minutes.   For some cancers, a special way of finding the best lymph node to biopsy is used. This is called sentinal lymph node biopsy, and it involves:  - A tiny amount of a tracer, either a radioactive tracer (radioisotope) or a blue dye, is injected at the tumor site.  - The tracer or dye flows into the nearest (local) node. This node is called the sentinel node.It is the first lymph node to whicha cancer spreads.  - The sentinel node and possibly one or two other lymph nodes are removed.   The sample is then sent to the laboratory for examination.  A needle biopsy involves inserting a needle into a lymph node. This type of biopsy is done less often because the results are not as helpful as with an open biopsy.

A choking person's airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the lungs. Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 to 6 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life.  Causes : Choking can be caused by any of the following:  - Eating too fast, not chewing food well, or eating with dentures that donotfit well  - Drinking alcohol (even a small amount of alcohol affects awareness)  - Being unconscious and breathing in vomit  - Breathing in small objects (young children)  - Injury to the head and face (for example, swelling, bleeding, or a deformity can cause choking)  - Swallowing problems after a stroke  - Enlarging tonsils or tumors of the neck and throat  - Problems with the esophagus (food pipe or swallowing tube)  Symptoms : When an older child or adult is choking, they willoften grab their throat with the hand.

Can you speak?\\\" DO NOT perform first aid if the person is coughing forcefully and is able to speak. A strong cough can dislodge the object. Encourage the person to keep coughing to dislodge the object.  If the person cannot speak or is having a hard time breathing, you need to act fast to help the person.

(adverse means unwanted or unexpected.) Almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.  A true drug allergy is caused by a series of chemical steps in the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.  The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. However, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE. Instead, it might produce other types of antibodies, or have other reactions that do not produce antibodies.  Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medication or vaccine.  Common allergy-causing drugs include:  -  Anticonvulsants   -  Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin)   -  Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)   -  Penicillin and related antibiotics   -  Sulfa drugs    Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered idiosyncratic. This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication. It is not due to a known chemical effect of the drug. Many people confuse an uncomfortable, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a true drug allergy.)  \", \"x\": 7.734131813049316, \"y\": 12.926133155822754}, {\"text\": \"What are the symptoms of Drug allergies ?

After a period of maintenance, the dose may be decreased slowly over a long time. This helps reduce the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Some people stay on methadone for years.  Buprenorphine (Subutex) treats withdrawal from opiates, and it can shorten the length of detox. It may also be used for long-term maintenance, like methadone. Buprenorphine may be combined with Naloxone (Bunavail, Suboxone, Zubsolv), which helps prevent dependence and misuse.

(Also called: Painkillers; Drugs for pain; Analgesics; Opioids) https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007489.htm Narcotics are also called opioid pain relievers. They are used only for pain that is severe and is not helped by other types of painkillers. When used carefully and under a health care provider's direct care, these drugs can be effective at reducing pain.  Narcotics work by binding to receptors in the brain, which blocks the feeling of pain.  You should not use a narcotic drug for more than 3 to 4 months, unless you are under direct care of your provider.  NAMES OF NARCOTICS  - Codeine  - Fentanyl -- available as a patch  - Hydrocodone  - Hydromorphone  - Meperidine  - Morphine  - Oxycodone  - Tramadol   TAKING NARCOTICS  These drugs can be abused and habit-forming. They have been associated with accidental overdose deaths. Always take narcotics as prescribed. Your provider may suggest that you take your medicine only when you feel pain.  Or, your doctor may suggest taking a narcotic on a regular schedule. Allowing the medicine to wear off before taking more of it can make the pain difficult to control.   Taking narcotics to control the pain of cancer or other medical problems does not itself lead to dependence.  Store narcotics safely and securely in your home.  You may need a pain specialist to help you manage long-term pain.  SIDE EFFECTS OF NARCOTICS  Drowsiness and impaired judgment often occur with these medicines. When taking a narcotic, do not drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery.  You can relieve itching by reducing the dose or talking to your doctor about switching medicines.  To help with constipation, drink more fluids, get more exercise, eat foods with extra fiber, and use stool softeners.  If nausea or vomiting occur, try taking the narcotic with food.

In reality, it isn't always easy to know when you're going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can drag on for days.  Keep in mind that your due date is just a general idea of when your labor may start. Normal term labor can start any time between 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after this date.  False labor (Braxton Hicks contractions) : Most pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which:  - Are typically short  - Are not painful  - Do not come at regular intervals  - Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement    This stage is called \\\"prodromal\\\" or \\\"latent\\\" labor.  Other signs that labor is near : Lightening: This happens when your baby's head \\\"drops\\\" down into your pelvis.   - Your belly will look lower. It will be easier for you to breathe because the baby is not putting pressure on your lungs.  - You may need to urinate more often because the baby is pressing on your bladder.  - For first-time mothers, lightening often happens a few weeks before birth. For women who have had babies before, it may not happen until labor has begun.    Bloody show: If you have bloody or brownish discharge from your vagina, it may mean your cervix has begun to dilate. The mucous plug that sealed your cervix for the last 9 months may be visible. This is a good sign. But active labor may still be days away.   Your baby moves less: If you feel less movement, call your doctor or midwife, as sometimes decreased movement can mean that the baby is in trouble.   Your water breaks: When the amniotic sac (bag of fluid around the baby) breaks, you will feel fluid leak from your vagina.

What you can do : Some people have trouble falling asleep. Others wake up in the middle of the night and cannot get back to sleep. You can change your habits and your home to make sleep less fleeting.   Stick to a sleep schedule:  - Go to bed and get up at the same time. Going to sleep at the same time every night trains your body and brain to wind down and get ready for slumber.  - Get up if you cannot sleep. If you lay awake for 15 minutes, get out of bed and go to another part of the house. This way your bed is less likely to become a place of stress.  - Do something quiet and relaxing like read a book. This can also help take your mind of the fact that you are not sleeping. When you feel drowsy, return to bed.    Make your bedroom comfortable:  - Get a comfortable mattress. If your mattress is lumpy, too soft, or too hard, it will be hard to get comfortable enough for sleep.  - Keep it cool. Your body temperature goes down when you sleep. Make sure your bedroom is cool enough but not so cool that you wake up cold. Experiment with the thermostat and blankets to find what temperature works for you.  - Control the light. Light from the street, a TV, or the next room can make it hard to stay asleep. Use curtains and doors to make your room dark so you can sleep. Or try using a sleep mask.  - Control sounds. Make your room as quiet as you can. You might use a fan, soft music, or sound machine to create white noise you can sleep to.  - Hide the clock. Watching the hours tick by can stress you out.

The lymph nodes are small glands that make white blood cells (lymphocytes), which fight infection. Lymph nodes may trap the germs that are causing an infection. Canceroften spreads to lymph nodes.  How the Test is Performed : A lymph node biopsy is done in an operating room in a hospital. Or, it is done at an outpatient surgical center. The biopsy may be done in different ways.  An open biopsy is surgery to remove all or part of the lymph node:   - You lie on the examination table. You may be given medicine to calm you and make you sleepy.  - The biopsy site is cleansed.  - The health care provider injects a local anesthetic (numbing medication) into the area. Sometimes, general anesthesia is used, which means you are asleep and pain-free.  - A small surgical cut (incision)is made. The lymph node or part of the node is removed.   - Theincision is closed with stitches and a bandage is applied.  - An open biopsy may take 30to 45 minutes.   For some cancers, a special way of finding the best lymph node to biopsy is used. This is called sentinal lymph node biopsy, and it involves:  - A tiny amount of a tracer, either a radioactive tracer (radioisotope) or a blue dye, is injected at the tumor site.  - The tracer or dye flows into the nearest (local) node. This node is called the sentinel node.It is the first lymph node to whicha cancer spreads.  - The sentinel node and possibly one or two other lymph nodes are removed.   The sample is then sent to the laboratory for examination.  A needle biopsy involves inserting a needle into a lymph node. This type of biopsy is done less often because the results are not as helpful as with an open biopsy.

How the Test is Performed : A sample is needed from a lymph node. The sample may be taken using a needle to draw fluid (aspiration) from the lymph node or during a lymph node biopsy.  The sample is sent to a laboratory. There, it is placed in a special dish and watched to see if bacteria, fungi, or viruses grow. This process is called a culture. Sometimes, special stains are also used to identify specific cells or microorganisms before culture results are available.  If needle aspiration does not provide a good enough sample, the entire lymph node may be removed and sent for culture and other testing.  How to Prepare for the Test : Your health care provider will instruct you on how to prepare for the lymph node sampling.  How the Test will Feel : When local anesthetic is injected, you will feel a prick and a mild stinging sensation. The site will likely be sore for a few days after the test.  Why the Test is Performed : Your doctor may order this test if you have swollen glands and infection is suspected.  Normal Results : A normal result means there was no growth of microorganisms on the lab dish.  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.  What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results are a sign of a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection.

The EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4 and EIF2B5 genes provide instructions for making the five parts (subunits) of a protein called eIF2B. The eIF2B protein helps regulate overall protein production (synthesis) in the cell by interacting with another protein, eIF2. The eIF2 protein is called an initiation factor because it is involved in starting (initiating) protein synthesis. Proper regulation of protein synthesis is vital for ensuring that the correct levels of protein are available for the cell to cope with changing conditions. For example, cells must synthesize protein much faster if they are multiplying than if they are in a resting state.  Mutations have been identified in all five of the genes from which the eIF2B protein is produced, although most of these mutations (about 65 percent) occur in the EIF2B5 gene. These mutations cause partial loss of eIF2B function in various ways. For example, they may impair the ability of one of the protein subunits to form a complex with the others, or make it more difficult for the protein to attach to the initiation factor.  Partial loss of eIF2B function makes it more difficult for the body's cells to regulate protein synthesis and deal with changing conditions and stress.

The SA node generates electrical impulses that start each heartbeat. These signals travel from the SA node to the rest of the heart, signaling the heart (cardiac) muscle to contract and pump blood. In people with sick sinus syndrome, the SA node does not function normally. In some cases, it does not produce the right signals to trigger a regular heartbeat. In others, abnormalities disrupt the electrical impulses and prevent them from reaching the rest of the heart.  Sick sinus syndrome tends to cause the heartbeat to be too slow (bradycardia), although occasionally the heartbeat is too fast (tachycardia). In some cases, the heartbeat rapidly switches from being too fast to being too slow, a condition known as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. Symptoms related to abnormal heartbeats can include dizziness, light-headedness, fainting (syncope), a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), and confusion or memory problems. During exercise, many affected individuals experience chest pain, difficulty breathing, or excessive tiredness (fatigue). Once symptoms of sick sinus syndrome appear, they usually worsen with time. However, some people with the condition never experience any related health problems.  Sick sinus syndrome occurs most commonly in older adults, although it can be diagnosed in people of any age. The condition increases the risk of several life-threatening problems involving the heart and blood vessels. These include a heart rhythm abnormality called atrial fibrillation, heart failure, cardiac arrest, and stroke.)  \", \"x\": -0.1805473268032074, \"y\": 6.744507789611816}, {\"text\": \"What are the genetic changes related to sick sinus syndrome ?

In many cases, the cause of the condition is unknown.  Genetic changes are an uncommon cause of sick sinus syndrome. Mutations in two genes, SCN5A and HCN4, have been found to cause the condition in a small number of families. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called ion channels that transport positively charged atoms (ions) into cardiac cells, including cells that make up the SA node. The flow of these ions is essential for creating the electrical impulses that start each heartbeat and coordinate contraction of the cardiac muscle. Mutations in these genes reduce the flow of ions, which alters the SA node's ability to create and spread electrical signals. These changes lead to abnormal heartbeats and the other symptoms of sick sinus syndrome.  A particular variation in another gene, MYH6, appears to increase the risk of developing sick sinus syndrome. The protein produced from the MYH6 gene forms part of a larger protein called myosin, which generates the mechanical force needed for cardiac muscle to contract. Researchers believe that the MYH6 gene variation changes the structure of myosin, which can affect cardiac muscle contraction and increase the likelihood of developing an abnormal heartbeat.  More commonly, sick sinus syndrome is caused by other factors that alter the structure or function of the SA node. These include a variety of heart conditions, other disorders such as muscular dystrophy, abnormal inflammation, or a shortage of oxygen (hypoxia). Certain medications, such as drugs given to treat abnormal heart rhythms or high blood pressure, can also disrupt SA node function.

However, some children have a narrow throat. This is often this is because of large tonsils or adenoids, which partially block the airflow. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea.  Other factors that also may increase the risk of sleep apnea in children include:  - A small jaw  - Certain shapes of the roof of the mouth (palate)   - Large tongue, which may fall back and block the airway  - Obesity  - Poor muscle tone due to conditions such as Down syndrome or cerebral palsy)  \", \"x\": 3.874329090118408, \"y\": 8.30289363861084}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Sleep Apnea ?

Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30times or more an hour. Typically, normal breathing then starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound.                  Sleep apnea usually is a chronic (ongoing) condition that disrupts your sleep. When your breathing pauses or becomes shallow, youll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep.                  As a result, the quality of your sleep is poor, which makes you tired during the day. Sleep apnea is a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness.                  Overview                  Sleep apnea often goes undiagnosed. Doctors usually can't detect the condition during routine office visits. Also, no blood test can help diagnose the condition.                  Most people who have sleep apnea don't know they have it because it only occurs during sleep. A family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea.                  The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In this condition, the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. This causes shallow breathing or breathing pauses.                  When you try to breathe, any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring. Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight, but it can affect anyone.

Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your \\\"blood alcohol level.\\\" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50\", \"x\": 5.922485828399658, \"y\": 4.510303974151611}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Asthma ?

Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.  - Read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner's manual, too.  - Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.

Ask if they test the water every day for the kind of germs that can give you an infection -- germs are called coliforms.  Well water : Boil water from a private well or a small community well before you drink it or use it for cooking or brushing your teeth.  Running well water through a filter or adding chlorine to it does not make it safe to use. Test your well water at least once a year for coliform germs that may cause an infection. Test your water more often if coliforms are found in it or if there is any question about the safety of your water.  To boil water and store it:  - Heat the water to a rolling boil.  - Keep the water boiling for at least 1 minute.  - After boiling the water, store it in the refrigerator in a clean and covered container.  - Use all this water within 3 days (72 hours). If you do not use it in this time, pour it down the drain or use it to water your plants or your garden.  Bottled water : The label on any bottled water you drink should say how it was cleaned.

Information : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober.

(Also called: extrinsic asthma) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/allergic-asthma Asthma is a breathing disorder characterized by inflammation of the airways and recurrent episodes of breathing difficulty. These episodes, sometimes referred to as asthma attacks, are triggered by irritation of the inflamed airways. In allergic asthma, the attacks occur when substances known as allergens are inhaled, causing an allergic reaction. Allergens are harmless substances that the body's immune system mistakenly reacts to as though they are harmful. Common allergens include pollen, dust, animal dander, and mold. The immune response leads to the symptoms of asthma. Allergic asthma is the most common form of the disorder.  A hallmark of asthma is bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which means the airways are especially sensitive to irritants and respond excessively. Because of this hyperresponsiveness, attacks can be triggered by irritants other than allergens, such as physical activity, respiratory infections, or exposure to tobacco smoke, in people with allergic asthma.  An asthma attack is characterized by tightening of the muscles around the airways (bronchoconstriction), which narrows the airway and makes breathing difficult. Additionally, the immune reaction can lead to swelling of the airways and overproduction of mucus. During an attack, an affected individual can experience chest tightness, wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. Over time, the muscles around the airways can become enlarged (hypertrophied), further narrowing the airways.  Some people with allergic asthma have another allergic disorder, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or food allergies. Asthma is sometimes part of a series of allergic disorders, referred to as the atopic march. Development of these conditions typically follows a pattern, beginning with eczema (atopic dermatitis), followed by food allergies, then hay fever, and finally asthma.

With osteoporosis, the bones lose density. Bone density is the amount of bone tissue in your bones.   Exercise plays a key role in preserving bone density as you age.  Why Exercise? : Make exercise a regular part of your life. It helps keep your bones strong and lower your risk of osteoporosis and fractures as you get older.   Before you begin an exercise program, talk with your doctor if:   - You are older  - You have not been active for a while  - You have diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, or any other health condition  How Much and What Type of Exercise? : To build up bone density, the exercise must make your muscles pull on your bones. These are called weight-bearing exercises. Some of them are:   - Brisk walks, jogging, playing tennis, dancing, or other weight-bearing activities such as aerobics and other sports  - Careful weight training, using weight machines or free weights    Weight bearing exercises also:   - Increase bone density even in young people  - Help preserve bone density in women who are approaching menopause    To protect your bones, do weight bearing exercises 3 or more days a week for a total of over 90 minutes a week.   If you are older, do not do high-impact aerobics, such as step aerobics. This type of exercise may increase your risk of fractures.

False labor (Braxton Hicks contractions) : Most pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which:  - Are typically short  - Are not painful  - Do not come at regular intervals  - Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement    This stage is called \\\"prodromal\\\" or \\\"latent\\\" labor.  Other signs that labor is near : Lightening: This happens when your baby's head \\\"drops\\\" down into your pelvis.   - Your belly will look lower.

This test records certain body functions as you as you sleep, or try to sleep. Polysomnography is used to diagnose sleep disorders.  How the Test is Performed : There are two states of sleep:  - Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep. Under normal circumstances, your muscles, except for your eyes and breathing muscles, do not move during this stage of sleep.  - Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. NREM has three stages that can be detected by brain waves (EEG).   REM sleep alternates with NREM sleep about every 90 minutes. A person with normal sleep usually has four to five cycles of REM and NREM sleep during a night.  A sleep study measures your sleep cycles and stages by recording:  - Air flow in and out of your lungs as you breathe  - The level of oxygen in your blood  - Body position  - Brain waves (EEG)  - Breathing effort and rate  - Electrical activity of muscles  - Eye movement  - Heart rate   Polysomnography can be done either at a sleep center or in your home.  AT A SLEEP CENTER  Full sleep studies are usually done at a special sleep center.  - You will be asked to arrive about 2 hours before bedtime.  - You will sleep in a bed at the center. Many sleep centers have comfortable bedrooms, similar to a hotel.  - The test isusually done at night so that your normal sleep patterns can be studied. If you are a night shift worker, many centers can perform the test during your normal sleep hours.  - Your health care provider will place electrodes on your chin, scalp, and the outer edge of your eyelids. You will have monitors to record your heart rate and breathing attached to your chest. These will remain in place while you sleep.  - The electrodes record signals while you are awake (with your eyes closed) and during sleep.

The person may ask to be moved up higher for comfort or may need to be moved up so a health care provider can do an exam.  Avoiding injury : You must move or pull someone up in bed the right way to avoid injuring the patient's shoulders and skin. Using the right method will also help protect your back.  It takes at least two people to safely move a patient up in bed.  Friction from rubbing can scrape or tear the person's skin. Common areas at risk for friction are the shoulders, back, buttocks, elbows, and heels.   Never move patients up by grabbing them under their arms and pulling. This can injure their shoulders.  Preparing to move the patient : A slide sheet is the best way to prevent friction. If you do not have one, you can make a draw sheet out of a bed sheet folded in half. Follow these steps to prepare the patient:  - Tell the patient what you are doing.  - Make the bed flat.  - Roll the patient to one side, then place a half rolled-up slide sheet or draw sheet against the person's back.  - Roll the patient onto the sheet and spread the sheet out flat under the person.  - Make sure the head, shoulders, and hips are on the sheet.  Pulling up : The goal is to pull, not lift, the patient toward the head of the bed. The two people moving the patient should stand on opposite sides of the bed. To pull the person up both people should:   - Grab the slide sheet or draw sheet on the side of the bed closest to you.  - Put one foot forward as you prepare to move the patient.  - On the count of three, move the patient by pulling the sheet toward the head of the bed.

Depending on the type of surgery you're having, follow any further advice from your doctor or nurse.  Medications : Two weeks before surgery, you may have been told to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. Among other drugs, this includes:  - Aspirin  - Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)  - Naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve)    Take only the medicines your doctor has told you to take before surgery, including prescription medicines. If you're confused about which medicines to take the night before or the day of surgery, call your doctor.  Do not take any supplements, herbs, vitamins, or minerals before surgery unless your doctor said it is OK.  Bring a list of all your medicines to the hospital. Include the ones that you were told to stop taking before surgery. Make sure you write down the dose and how often you take them. If possible, bring your medicines in their containers.  Washing your skin : You may take a shower or bath both the night before and the morning of surgery.  Your doctor or nurse may have given you a medicated soap to use. Read the instructions for how to use this soap. If you were not given medicated soap, use antibacterial soap that you can buy at the store.  Do not shave the area that will be operated on. The doctors or nurses will do that at the hospital, if needed.  Scrub your fingernails with a brush. Remove nail polish and makeup before you go to the hospital.

Make sure the rail is up on the side you are turning the person toward.  - The patient's bottom arm should be stretched towards you. Place the person's top arm across the chest.  - Cross the patient's upper ankle over the bottom ankle.    If you are turning the patient onto the stomach, make sure the person's bottom hand is above the head first.  Turning a patient : - If you can, raise the bed to a level that reduces back strain for you. Make the bed flat.  - Get as close to the person as you can.  - Place one of your hands on the patient's shoulder and your other hand on the hip.  - Standing with one foot ahead of the other, shift your weight to your front foot as you gently pull the patient's shoulder toward you. Then shift your weight to your back foot as you gently pull the person's hip toward you.    You may need to repeat steps 3 and 4 until the patient is in the right position.  When the patient is in the right position : - Make sure the patient's ankles, knees, and elbows are not resting on top of each other.  - Make sure the head and neck are in line with the spine, not stretched forward, back, or to the side.  - Return the bed to a comfortable position with the side rails up.

A normal heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. These signals begin in a specialized cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node (the heart's natural pacemaker) located in the heart's upper chambers (the atria). From there, a group of cells called the atrioventricular node carries the electrical signals to another cluster of cells called the bundle of His. This bundle separates into multiple thin spindles called bundle branches, which carry electrical signals into the heart's lower chambers (the ventricles). Electrical impulses move from the sinoatrial node down to the bundle branches, stimulating a normal heartbeat in which the ventricles contract slightly later than the atria.  Heart block occurs when the electrical signaling is obstructed anywhere from the atria to the ventricles. In people with progressive familial heart block, the condition worsens over time: early in the disorder, the electrical signals are partially blocked, but the block eventually becomes complete, preventing any signals from passing through the heart. Partial heart block causes a slow or irregular heartbeat (bradycardia or arrhythmia, respectively), and can lead to the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the cells that carry electrical impulses. Fibrosis contributes to the development of complete heart block, resulting in uncoordinated electrical signaling between the atria and the ventricles and inefficient pumping of blood in the heart. Complete heart block can cause a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), \", \"x\": -0.019807523116469383, \"y\": 6.549140930175781}, {\"text\": \"How many people are affected by progressive familial heart block ?

The proteins produced from these genes are channels that allow positively charged atoms (cations) into and out of cells. Both channels are abundant in heart (cardiac) cells and play key roles in these cells' ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. These channels play a major role in signaling the start of each heartbeat, coordinating the contractions of the atria and ventricles, and maintaining a normal heart rhythm.  The SCN5A and TRPM4 gene mutations that cause progressive familial heart block alter the normal function of the channels. As a result of these channel alterations, cardiac cells have difficulty producing and transmitting the electrical signals that are necessary to coordinate normal heartbeats, leading to heart block.

TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered \\\"problem drinkers.\\\" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your \\\"blood alcohol level.\\\" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50\", \"x\": 5.908497333526611, \"y\": 4.524081707000732}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Allergic reactions ? https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000005.htm Allergic reactions are sensitivities to substances called allergens that come into contact with the skin, nose, eyes, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract.

Many allergic reactions are mild, while others can be severe and life-threatening. They can be confined to a small area of the body, or they may affect the entire body. The most severe form is called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock. Allergic reactions occur more often in people who have a family history of allergies.  Substances that don't bother most people (such as venom from bee stings and certain foods, medications, and pollens) can trigger allergic reactions in certain people.  First-time exposure may produce only a mild reaction. Repeated exposures may lead to more serious reactions. Once a person has had an exposure or an allergic reaction (is sensitized), even a very limited exposure to a very small amount of allergen can trigger a severe reaction.  Most severe allergic reactions occur within seconds or minutes after exposure to the allergen. Some reactions can occur after several hours, particularly if the allergen causes a reaction after it has been eaten. In very rare cases, reactions develop after 24 hours.  Anaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic reaction that occurs within minutes of exposure. Immediate medical attention is needed for this condition.

It opens up many options for a young person, but it also carries risks. Young people between ages 15 and 24 have the highest rate of auto-related deaths. The rate is the highest for young men.   Parents and teens should be aware of problem areas and take steps to avoid hazards.  Information : Make a Commitment to Safety  Teens also need to commit to being safe and responsible drivers in order to improve the odds in their favor.  - Reckless driving is still a danger to teens -- even with automobile safety features.  - All new drivers should take a driver's education course. These courses can reduce risk for crashes.    Drivers and passengers should use automobile safety features at all times. These include: seat belts, shoulder straps, and headrests. Only drive cars that have air bags, padded dashes, safety glass, collapsible steering columns, and anti-lock brakes.  Auto accidents are also a leading cause of death in infants and children. Infants and young children should be properly buckled into a child safety seat of the right size that is correctly installed in the vehicle.  Avoid Distracted Driving   Distractions are a problem for all drivers. Do not use cell phones for talking, texting, or email when you are driving.   - Mobile phones should be turned off when driving so you are not tempted to make calls, send or read texts, or answer the phone.  - If phones are left on for emergency use, pull off of the road before answering or texting.    Other tips include:  - Avoid putting on makeup while driving, even when stopped at a light or stop sign, it can be dangerous.  - Finish eating before starting your car and driving.    Driving with friends can lead to accidents.  - Teens are safer driving alone or with family.

Information : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober.

Here are tips to help you keep track of your medicines and take them as directed.  Why you may Need More Than one Medicine : You may take more than one medicine to treat a single condition. Or you may take different medicines to treat more than one health problem. For example, you may take a statin to lower your cholesterol, and a beta-blocker to control your blood pressure.   Older adults often have more than one health condition. So they are more likely to take several medicines.  Risks of Taking Multiple Medicines : The more medicines you take, the more you need to use them carefully.

This lining is called the endometrium.  Description : Most often, a tool called a hysteroscope is used. It is a thin, lighted tube. It sends images of the inside of the womb to a video monitor.  - Most times, the procedure is performed under general anesthesia, but sometimes it is performed in the office under light sedation.  - The health care provider places the scope through the vagina and cervix and into the womb.  - Gas or fluid may be placed into the womb so it expands. This helps the provider see the area better.  - Pictures of the womb can be seen on the video screen.   Small tools can be used through the scope to remove abnormal growths or tissue for examination. Ablation uses heat, cold, or electricity to destroy the lining of the womb.  The procedure takes about 45 minutes.  Why the Procedure is Performed : This procedure can treat heavy or irregular periods. Your doctor will likely have tried other treatments first, such as hormone medicines or an IUD.  Endometrial ablation will not be used if you may want to become pregnant in the future. Though this procedure does not prevent you from getting pregnant, it may reduce your chances of getting pregnant. Reliable contraception is important in all women who get the procedure.  If a woman gets pregnant after an ablation procedure, the pregnancy will often miscarry or be extremely high risk because of the scar tissue in the uterus.

These are attached by wires to a small recording monitor. You carry the Holter monitor in a pocket or pouch worn around your neck or waist. The monitor runs on batteries.   While you wear the monitor, it records your heart's electrical activity.   - Keep a diary of what activities you do while wearing the monitor, and how you feel.  - After 24 to 48 hours, you will return the monitor to your doctor's office.  - The doctor will look at the records and see if there have been any abnormal heart rhythms.     It is very important that you accurately record your symptoms and activities so the doctor can match them with your Holter monitor findings.  Electrodes must be firmly attached to the chest so the machine gets an accurate recording of the heart's activity.

However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.

During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm.                  A heartbeat that is too fast is called tachycardia (TAK-ih-KAR-de-ah). A heartbeat that is too slow is called bradycardia (bray-de-KAR-de-ah).                  Most arrhythmias are harmless, but some can be serious or even life threatening. During an arrhythmia, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. Lack of blood flow can damage the brain, heart, and other organs.                  Understanding the Heart's Electrical System                  To understand arrhythmias, it helps to understand the heart's internal electrical system. The heart's electrical system controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat.                  With each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. As the signal travels, it causes the heart to contract and pump blood.                  Each electrical signal begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial (SA) node. The SA node is located in the heart's upper right chamber, the right atrium (AY-tree-um). In a healthy adult heart at rest, the SA node fires off an electrical signal to begin a new heartbeat 60 to 100 times a minute.                  From the SA node, the electrical signal travels through special pathways in the right and left atria. This causes the atria to contract and pump blood into the heart's two lower chambers, the ventricles (VEN-trih-kuls).                  The electrical signal then moves down to a group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node, located between the atria and the ventricles. Here, the signal slows down just a little, allowing the ventricles time to finish filling with blood.                  The electrical signal then leaves the AV node and travels along a pathway called the bu\", \"x\": 0.5488281846046448, \"y\": 6.778783798217773}, {\"text\": \"What causes Arrhythmia ? http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/arr An arrhythmia can occur if the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are delayed or blocked. This can happen if the special nerve cells that produce electrical signals don't work properly. It also can happen if the electrical signals don't travel normally through the heart.                  An arrhythmia also can occur if another part of the heart starts to produce electrical signals. This adds to the signals from the special nerve cells and disrupts the normal heartbeat.                  Smoking, heavy alcohol use, use of some drugs (such as cocaine or amphetamines), use of some prescription or over-the-counter medicines, or too much caffeine or nicotine can lead to arrhythmias in some people.                  Strong emotional stress or anger can make the heart work harder, raise blood pressure, and release stress hormones. Sometimes these reactions can lead to arrhythmias.                  A heart attack or other condition that damages the heart's electrical system also can cause arrhythmias.

Medicine is more important if your teen is severely depressed. In these cases, talk therapy alone cannot be effective.  If you decide that medicine would help, your provider will most likely prescribe a type of anti-depressant medicine called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for your teen.  The two most common SSRI medicines are fluoxetine (Prozac) and escitalopram (Lexapro). These are approved to treat depression in teenagers. Prozac is also approved for children age 8 and older.  Another type of antidepressants, called tri-cyclics, is not approved for use in teens.  There are risks and side effects with taking antidepressants. Your teen's provider can help manage these side effects. In a small number of teens, these medicines can make them more depressed and give them more suicidal thoughts.

Types of Health Insurance Plans : Depending on how you get your health insurance, you may have a choice of different types of plans.  Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). These plans offer a network of health care providers and low monthly premiums. The providers have a contract with the health plan. This means they charge a set rate for services. You will choose a primary care doctor. This person will manage your care and refer you to specialists. If you use doctors, hospitals, and other providers from the plan's network, you pay less out of pocket. If you use providers outside of the network, you will have to pay more.  Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs). These are plans that offer networks of providers and low monthly premiums. You must use the doctors, hospitals, and other providers from the network list to keep your out-of-pocket costs low. If you see providers outside of the network, your costs will be much higher. With EPOs, you do not need a primary care doctor to manage your care and give you referrals.  Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs). PPOs offer a network of providers and the choice to see providers outside of the network for a bit more money. You do not need a primary care doctor to manage your care. You will pay more in premiums for this plan compared to an HMO, but you have a bit more freedom to see providers inside and outside the network without the need for referrals.

There are many causes of vaginal dryness. It may be caused by reduced estrogen levels, infection, medicines, and other things. Before treating yourself, talk to your health care provider.   Water-based lubricants and vaginal moisturizers work very well. Lubricants will moisten the vaginal opening and lining for several hours. The effects of a vaginal cream can last for up to a day.  Soybeans contain plant-based substances called isoflavones. These substances have an effect of the body that is similar to estrogen, but weaker. Therefore, it would seem that a diet rich in soy foods would improve symptoms of vaginal dryness. There continues to be research in this area, but the ideal sources or dose is still unknown. Soy foods include tofu, soy milk, and whole soybeans (also called edamame).  Many women claim that creams containing wild yam help with vaginal dryness. However, there is no good research that has evaluated these creams. Also, extracts of wild yam have not been found to have estrogen- or progesterone-like activities. Some of the products may have synthetic medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) added. MPA is a derivative of progesterone, and is also used in oral contraceptives.

Then you can plan ahead so that you can keep working with as little interruption as possible.  How Cancer May Affect You at Work : If you feel well enough, you may find that the daily routine of a job helps you maintain a sense of balance. But having unrealistic goals could cause extra stress. If possible, prepare yourself for the ways cancer could affect you at work:  - You may need to take time off for treatments.  - You may get tired more easily.  - At times, you could be distracted by pain or stress.  - You could have trouble remembering some things.  Tips to Help You Work During Treatment : There are ways you can plan ahead to make working through cancer easier on you and your co-workers.  - Schedule treatments late in the day so you can go home afterwards.  - Try to schedule chemotherapy at the end of the week so you have the weekend to recover.  - Talk to your manager about working at home some days, if possible.

(Also called: alternating hemiplegia syndrome) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alternating-hemiplegia-of-childhood Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side of the body to the other or affects both sides at the same time. These episodes begin in infancy or early childhood, usually before 18 months of age, and the paralysis lasts from minutes to days.  In addition to paralysis, affected individuals can have sudden attacks of uncontrollable muscle activity; these can cause involuntary limb movements (choreoathetosis), muscle tensing (dystonia), movement of the eyes (nystagmus), or shortness of breath (dyspnea). People with alternating hemiplegia of childhood may also experience sudden redness and warmth (flushing) or unusual paleness (pallor) of the skin. These attacks can occur during or separately from episodes of hemiplegia.  The episodes of hemiplegia or uncontrolled movements can be triggered by certain factors, such as stress, extreme tiredness, cold temperatures, or bathing, although the trigger is not always known. A characteristic feature of alternating hemiplegia of childhood is that all symptoms disappear while the affected person is sleeping but can reappear shortly after awakening. The number and length of the episodes initially worsen throughout childhood but then begin to decrease over time. The uncontrollable muscle movements may disappear entirely, but the episodes of hemiplegia occur throughout life.  Alternating hemiplegia of childhood also causes mild to severe cognitive problems. Almost all affected individuals have some level of developmental delay and intellectual disability.

They function as different forms of one piece, the alpha subunit, of a larger protein complex called Na+/K+ ATPase; the two versions of the complex are found in different parts of the brain. Both versions play a critical role in the normal function of nerve cells (neurons). Na+/K+ ATPase transports charged atoms (ions) into and out of neurons, which is an essential part of the signaling process that controls muscle movement.  Mutations in the ATP1A3 or ATP1A2 gene reduce the activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase, impairing its ability to transport ions normally.

Researchers have described four HDL syndromes, designated Huntington disease-like 1 (HDL1) through Huntington disease-like 4 (HDL4). These progressive brain disorders are characterized by uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. HDL syndromes occur in people with the characteristic features of Huntington disease who do not have a mutation in HD, the gene typically associated with that disorder.  HDL1, HDL2, and HDL4 usually appear in early to mid-adulthood, although they can begin earlier in life. The first signs and symptoms of these conditions often include irritability, emotional problems, small involuntary movements, poor coordination, and trouble learning new information or making decisions. Many affected people develop involuntary jerking or twitching movements known as chorea. As the disease progresses, these abnormal movements become more pronounced. Affected individuals may develop problems with walking, speaking, and swallowing. People with these disorders also experience changes in personality and a decline in thinking and reasoning abilities. Individuals with an HDL syndrome can live for a few years to more than a decade after signs and symptoms begin.  HDL3 begins much earlier in life than most of the other HDL syndromes (usually around age 3 or 4).

(Also called: HID syndrome; ichthyosis, hystrix-like, with deafness) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hystrix-like-ichthyosis-with-deafness HID is caused by mutations in the GJB2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 2, more commonly known as connexin 26. Connexin 26 is a member of the connexin protein family. Connexin proteins form channels called gap junctions that permit the transport of nutrients, charged atoms (ions), and signaling molecules between neighboring cells that are in contact with each other. Gap junctions made with connexin 26 transport potassium ions and certain small molecules.  Connexin 26 is found in cells throughout the body, including the inner ear and the skin. In the inner ear, channels made from connexin 26 are found in a snail-shaped structure called the cochlea. These channels may help to maintain the proper level of potassium ions required for the conversion of sound waves to electrical nerve impulses. This conversion is essential for normal hearing. In addition, connexin 26 may be involved in the maturation of certain cells in the cochlea. Connexin 26 also plays a role in the growth and maturation of the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis).  At least one GJB2 gene mutation has been identified in people with HID. This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in connexin 26. The mutation is thought to result in channels that constantly leak ions, which impairs the health of the cells and increases cell death. Death of cells in the skin and the inner ear may underlie the signs and symptoms of HID.  Because the GJB2 gene mutation identified in people with HID also occurs in keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome (KID syndrome), a disorder with similar features and the addition of eye abnormalities, many researchers categorize KID syndrome and HID as a single disorder, which they call KID/HID.

(Also called: NPH; NPHP) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/nephronophthisis Nephronophthisis is a disorder that affects the kidneys. It is characterized by inflammation and scarring (fibrosis) that impairs kidney function. These abnormalities lead to increased urine production (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), general weakness, and extreme tiredness (fatigue). In addition, affected individuals develop fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, usually in an area known as the corticomedullary region. Another feature of nephronophthisis is a shortage of red blood cells, a condition known as anemia.  Nephronophthisis eventually leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening failure of kidney function that occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively. Nephronophthisis can be classified by the approximate age at which ESRD begins: around age 1 (infantile), around age 13 (juvenile), and around age 19 (adolescent).  About 85 percent of all cases of nephronophthisis are isolated, which means they occur without other signs and symptoms. Some people with nephronophthisis have additional features, which can include liver fibrosis, heart abnormalities, or mirror image reversal of the position of one or more organs inside the body (situs inversus).  Nephronophthisis can occur as part of separate syndromes that affect other areas of the body; these are often referred to as nephronophthisis-associated ciliopathies. For example, Senior-Lken syndrome is characterized by the combination of nephronophthisis and a breakdown of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retinal degeneration); Joubert syndrome affects many parts of the body, causing neurological problems and other features, which can include nephronophthisis.)  \", \"x\": -0.8642105460166931, \"y\": 7.303023338317871}, {\"text\": \"How can I learn more about Meningococcal Group B Vaccine (MenB) ? https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a615045.html - Ask your health care provider.

It occurs if the normal flow of CSF throughout the brain and spinal cord is blocked in some way. This causes the ventricles to enlarge, putting pressure on the brain.

Doctors call this condition \\\"depressive disorder,\\\" or \\\"clinical depression.\\\" Depression in Older Adults Important life changes that happen as we get older may cause feelings of uneasiness, stress, and sadness. For instance, the death of a loved one, moving from work into retirement, or dealing with a serious illness can leave people feeling sad or anxious. After a period of adjustment, many older adults can regain their emotional balance, but others do not and may develop depression. Depression is a common problem among older adults, but it is NOT a normal part of aging. In fact, studies show that most older adults feel satisfied with their lives, despite having more physical ailments. However, when older adults do suffer from depression, it may be overlooked because they may be less willing to talk about feelings of sadness or grief, or they may show different, less obvious symptoms, and doctors may be less likely to suspect or spot it. Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish grief from major depression. Grief after loss of a loved one is a normal reaction to the loss and generally does not require professional mental health treatment. However, grief that lasts for a very long time following a loss may require treatment. Test Depression and Suicide Though it is widely believed that suicide more often affects young people, suicide is a serious problem among older adults, too  particularly among older men  and depression is usually a major contributing factor.

In other cases, your body mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver.    Some people who have hepatitis have no symptoms. Others may have       - Loss of appetite    - Nausea and vomiting    - Diarrhea    - Dark-colored urine and pale bowel movements    - Stomach pain    - Jaundice, yellowing of skin and eyes       Some forms of hepatitis are mild, and others can be serious. Some can lead to scarring, called cirrhosis, or to liver cancer.    Sometimes hepatitis goes away by itself. If it does not, it can be treated with drugs. Sometimes hepatitis lasts a lifetime. Vaccines can help prevent some viral forms.)  \", \"x\": 2.4220924377441406, \"y\": 10.670820236206055}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Sexually Transmitted Diseases ?

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.  In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin.  - The blood collects in a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip.  - A bandage is put over the spot to stop any bleeding.  How to Prepare for the Test : No special preparation is needed.  For children, it may be helpful to explain how the test will feel and why it is done. This may make the child feel less nervous.  How the Test will Feel : You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.  Why the Test is Performed : This test is used to screen people at risk for lead poisoning. This may include industrial workers and children who live in urban areas. The test is also used to measure how well treatment for lead poisoning is working. Lead is common in the environment, so it is often found in the body in low levels.  Normal Results : Small amounts of lead in adults are not thought to be harmful. However, even low levels of lead can be dangerous to infants and children. It can cause lead poisoning that leads to problems in mental development.  Adults:  - Less than 10 micrograms per deciliter (dL) of lead in the blood    Children:  - Less than 5 micrograms/dL of lead in the blood    Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

A young, physically fit Navajo man suffering from shortness of breath was rushed to a hospital in New Mexico and died very rapidly.

An investigation combing the entire Four Corners region was launched by the New Mexico Office of Medical Investigations (OMI) to find any other people who had a similar case history. Within a few hours, Dr. Bruce Tempest of IHS, working with OMI, had located five young, healthy people who had all died after acute respiratory failure.    A series of laboratory tests had failed to identify any of the deaths as caused by a known disease, such as bubonic plague. At this point, the CDC Special Pathogens Branch was notified. CDC, the state health departments of New Mexico, Colorado and Utah, the Indian Health Service, the Navajo Nation, and the University of New Mexico all joined together to confront the outbreak.        During the next few weeks, as additional cases of the disease were reported in the Four Corners area, physicians and other scientific experts worked intensively to narrow down the list of possible causes.

A test can be done to measure the amount of this protein in your blood.  How the Test is Performed : Blood is drawn from a vein. Most of the time, a vein on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is used. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.  Next, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm.  Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.  In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.  How to Prepare for the Test : Your provider may tell you to stop taking some medicines that could interfere with the test.

(Also called: MG) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/myasthenia-gravis Myasthenia gravis is a disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. The weakness most often starts in the muscles around the eyes, causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and difficulty coordinating eye movements, which results in blurred or double vision. In a form of the disorder called ocular myasthenia, the weakness remains confined to the eye muscles. In most people with myasthenia gravis, however, additional muscles in the face and neck are affected. Affected individuals may have unusual facial expressions, difficulty holding up the head, speech impairment (dysarthria), and chewing and swallowing problems (dysphagia) that may lead to choking, gagging, or drooling.  Other muscles in the body are also affected in some people with myasthenia gravis. The muscles of the arms and legs may be involved, causing affected individuals to have changes in their gait or trouble with lifting objects, rising from a seated position, or climbing stairs. The muscle weakness tends to fluctuate over time; it typically worsens with activity and improves with rest.  Weakness of the muscles in the chest wall and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can cause breathing problems in some people with myasthenia gravis. About 10 percent of people with this disorder experience a potentially life-threatening complication in which these respiratory muscles weaken to the point that breathing is dangerously impaired, and the affected individual requires ventilation assistance. This respiratory failure, called a myasthenic crisis, may be triggered by stresses such as infections or reactions to medications.  People can develop myasthenia gravis at any age. For reasons that are unknown, it is most commonly diagnosed in women younger than age 40 and men older than age 60.

(Also called: MG) https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/myasthenia-gravis Researchers believe that variations in particular genes may increase the risk of myasthenia gravis, but the identity of these genes is unknown. Many factors likely contribute to the risk of developing this complex disorder.  Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder, which occurs when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In myasthenia gravis, the immune system disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles by producing a protein called an antibody that attaches (binds) to proteins important for nerve signal transmission. Antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but the antibody in myasthenia gravis attacks a normal human protein. In most affected individuals, the antibody targets a protein called acetylcholine receptor (AChR); in others, the antibodies attack a related protein called muscle-specific kinase (MuSK). In both cases, the abnormal antibodies lead to a reduction of available AChR.  The AChR protein is critical for signaling between nerve and muscle cells, which is necessary for movement. In myasthenia gravis, because of the abnormal immune response, less AChR is present, which reduces signaling between nerve and muscle cells. These signaling abnormalities lead to decreased muscle movement and the muscle weakness characteristic of this condition.  It is unclear why the immune system malfunctions in people with myasthenia gravis. About 75 percent of affected individuals have an abnormally large and overactive thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone that plays an important role in the immune system. The thymus sometimes develops tumors (thymomas) that are usually noncancerous (benign). However, the relationship between the thymus problems and the specific immune system malfunction that occurs in myasthenia gravis is not well understood.

It allows the baby to get nutrients, blood, and oxygen from the mother. It also helps the baby get rid of waste.  Placenta abruptio (also called placental abruption) is when the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus before the baby is born.  More About This Condition : In most pregnancies, the placenta stays attached to the upper part of the uterine wall.  In a small number of pregnancies, the placenta detaches (pulls itself from the wall of the uterus) too early. Most of the time, only part of the placenta pulls away. Other times it pulls away completely. If this happens, it is usually in the 3rd trimester.  The placenta is the lifeline of a fetus. Serious problems occur if it detaches. The baby gets less oxygen and fewer nutrients. Some babies become growth restricted (very small), and in a small number of cases, it is fatal. It can also cause significant blood loss for the mother.  What Causes It? : No one knows what causes placental abruption. But these factors raise a woman's risk for it:  - Long-term (chronic) high blood pressure  - Sudden high blood pressure in pregnant women who had normal blood pressure in the past  - Heart disease  - Diabetes  - Smoking  - Alcohol or cocaine use  - Placental abruption in an earlier pregnancy  - An injury to the mother (such as a car crash or fall in which the abdomen was hit)  - Being African American  - Being older than 40  Signs of Placental Abruption : The most common symptoms are vaginal bleeding and painful contractions. The amount of bleeding depends on how much of the placenta has detached. Sometimes the blood that collects when the placenta detaches stays between the placenta and uterine wall, so you may not have bleeding from your vagina.  - If the separation is \", \"x\": 2.126096725463867, \"y\": 5.848663330078125}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Separation anxiety in children ? https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001542.htm Separation anxiety in children is a developmental stage during which the child experiences anxiety when separated from the primary caregiver (usually the mother).)  \", \"x\": 3.1519157886505127, \"y\": 7.940699577331543}, {\"text\": \"What causes Separation anxiety in children ? https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001542.htm As infants develop, they experience various emotions, usually in a predictable order. Before 8 months, infants are so new to the world that they have little knowledge of what is ordinary and what may be dangerous, so new situations or experiences seem usual, and not frightening.  In normal development, during this early period the infant becomes familiar with the home environment, and feels comfortable when parents or other known caretakers are present. After this time, lack of familiarity often produces fear because the infant recognizes that something unusual is going on.  From 8to 14 months, children often become frightened when they meet new people or visit new places. They recognize their parents as familiar and safe. When separated from their parents, particularly when away from home, they feel threatened and unsafe.  Separation anxiety is a normal developmental stage. It helped keep our ancestors alive and helps children learn how to master their environment.  It usually ends when the child is around 2 years old. At this age, toddlers begin to understand that parents may be out of sight now, but will return later. There is also a normal desire to test their independence.  To get over separation anxiety, children must:  - Feel safe in their home environment  - Trust people other than their parents  - Trust that their parents will return   Even after children have successfully mastered this developmental stage, separation anxiety may return during periods of stress. Most children will experience some degree of separation anxiety when in unfamiliar situations, especially when separated from their parents.  When children are in situations (such as hospitals) and are experiencing stress (such as illness or pain), they seek the safety, comfort, and protection of their parents.

Considerations : The skull of an infant or young child is made up of bony plates that allow for growth. The borders where these plates come together are called sutures or suture lines.  In an infant only a few minutes old, the pressure from delivery may compress the head. This makes the bony plates overlap at the sutures and creates a small ridge. This is normal in newborns. In the next few days the baby's head expands. The overlap disappears and disappears and the edges of the bony plates meet edge to edge. This is the normal position.  Diseases or conditions that cause an abnormal increase in the pressure within the head can cause the sutures to spread apart. These separated sutures can be a sign of pressure within the skull (increased intracranial pressure).  Separated sutures may be associated with bulging fontanelles. If intracranial pressure is increased a lot, there may be large veins over the scalp.  Causes : The problem may be caused by:  - Arnold-Chiari malformation  - Battered child syndrome  - Bleeding inside the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage)  - Brain tumor  - Certain vitamin deficiencies  - Dandy-Walker malformation  - Down syndrome  - Hydrocephalus  - Infections that are present at birth (congenital infections)  - Lead poisoning  - Meningitis  - Subdural hematoma or subdural effusion  - Underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)  When to Contact a Medical Professional : Contact your health care provider if your child has:  - Separated sutures, bulging fontanelles, or very obvious scalp veins  - Redness, swelling, or discharge from the area of the sutures  What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will perform a physical exam.

TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered \\\"problem drinkers.\\\" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your \\\"blood alcohol level.\\\" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50\", \"x\": 5.934677600860596, \"y\": 4.496450901031494}, {\"text\": \"What is (are) Dementia - keeping safe in the home ? https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000031.htm It is important to make sure the homes of people who have dementia are safe for them.)  \", \"x\": -0.5070183277130127, \"y\": 2.885266065597534}, {\"text\": \"Do you have information about Safe eating during cancer treatment https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000061.htm Summary : When you have cancer, you need good nutrition to help keep your body strong.

Information : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober.

Surgery for cancer:  - Pelvic surgery can cause pain and problems having sex or getting pregnant.  - Some women who have surgery to remove all or part of a breast find they have less interest in sex.  - The type of side effects you have depends on which part of the body where you have the surgery and how much tissue is removed.    Chemotherapy can cause:  - Loss of sexual desire  - Pain with sex and problems having an orgasm  - Vaginal dryness and shrinking and thinning of the vaginal walls due to lower estrogen.  - Problems with fertility    Radiation therapy ca\", \"x\": 0.5599098205566406, \"y\": 8.276467323303223}, {\"text\": \"What are the treatments for Ehrlichiosis ?

Children should not take tetracycline by mouth until after all their permanent teeth have grown in, because it can permanently change the color of growing teeth. Doxycycline that is used for 2 weeks or less usually does not discolor a child's permanent teeth.

Measures should be taken to prevent tick bites, including:  - Wear long pants and long sleeves when walking through heavy brush, tall grass, and thickly wooded areas.  - Pull your socks over the outside of pants to prevent ticks from crawling up your leg.  - Keep your shirt tucked into your pants.  - Wear light-colored clothes so that ticks can be spotted easily.  - Spray your clothes with insect repellent.  - Check your clothes and skin often while in the woods.   After returning home:  - Remove your clothes. Look closely at all skin surfaces, including scalp. Ticks can quickly climb up the length of body.  - Some ticks are large and easy to locate. Other ticks can be quite small, so carefully look at all black or brown spots on the skin.  - If possible, ask someone to help you examine your body for ticks.  - An adult should examine children carefully.   Studies suggest that a tick must be attached to your body for at least 24 hours to cause disease. Early removal may prevent infection.  If you are bitten by a tick, write down the date and time the bite happened.

Information : An effective exercise program needs to be fun and keep you motivated. It helps to have a goal.  Your goal might be to:  - Manage a health condition  - Reduce stress  - Improve your stamina  - Buy clothes in a smaller size    Your exercise program can also be a good way for you to socialize. Taking exercise classes or exercising with a friend are both good ways to be social.  You may have a hard time starting an exercise routine, but once you do start, you may begin to notice other benefits, such as:  - Better control of your weight and appetite  - Improved fitness, making it easier to do everyday activities  - Improved sleep  - More confidence in yourself  - Lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure    GETTING STARTED  You do not need to join a gym to exercise. If you have not exercised or been active in a long time, start slowly to prevent injuries. Taking a brisk 10-minute walk twice a week is a good start.  Try joining a dance, yoga, or karate class if it appeals to you. You could also join a baseball or bowling team, or even a mall-walking group. The social aspects of these groups can be rewarding and motivating.  The most important thing is to do exercises that you can maintain and enjoy.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Talk with your health care provider before starting an exercise program if:  - You have diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, or another long-term illness  - You are obese  - You have not been very active lately  - You get chest pains or shortness of breath when you are active    Build physical activity into your regular routine  Simple lifestyle changes can make a big difference over time.  - At work, try taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking down the hall to talk\", \"x\": 3.3434407711029053, \"y\": 7.109436511993408}, {\"text\": \"How to prevent Sleeping sickness ?

       " 'answer': 'Most cases of polycystic kidney disease have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. People with this condition are born with one mutated copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene in each cell. In about 90 percent of these cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The other 10 percent of cases result from a new mutation in one of the genes and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  Although one altered copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, an additional mutation in the second copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene may make cysts grow faster and increase the severity of the disease. The rate at which cysts enlarge and cause a loss of kidney function varies widely, and may be influenced by mutations in other genes that have not been identified.  Polycystic kidney disease also can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. People with this form of the condition have two altered copies of the PKHD1 gene in each cell. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.)  '}"
